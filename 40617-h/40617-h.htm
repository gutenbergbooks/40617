<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> present work, begun during the author's tenure of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">-v-</a></span>
Faulkner Fellowship in the University of Manchester, and
completed in subsequent years, is an endeavour to trace the
history of the teaching and use of French in England during
a given epoch, ending with the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes and the Revolution of 1689, which events mark the
beginning of a new period in the study of the French language
in this country. No attempt has been made to treat the
wider topic of French influence in England in its literary and
social aspects (this has already been done by competent
hands), though this side of the question is naturally touched
upon occasionally by way of reference or illustration.</p>

<p>I gladly take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude
to Professor L. E. Kastner, at whose suggestion this investigation
was undertaken, for his generous assistance, and the
unfailing interest he has shown in my work during the whole
course of its preparation. I am likewise considerably indebted
to Dr. Ph&#339;be Sheavyn for helpful criticism and
advice, to Professor Tout for kindly reading through the
introductory chapter, and to Mr. J. Marks for a careful revision
of the proofs and many useful indications. I owe a great
deal to my father also, whose sympathetic advice and encouragement
did much to lighten my task. Nor can I close
this list of acknowledgments without recording my obligation
to the Secretary of the Press, Mr. H. M. McKechnie, for the
valuable assistance he has so freely given me during the
progress of this volume through the Press.</p>

<h3>THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> first important grammar of the French language was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-3-</a></span>
printed in England and written by an Englishman. This
enterprising student was John Palsgrave, "natyf de Londres
et gradué de Paris," whose work, entitled <i>L'Esclarcissement
de la langue francoyse</i>, was published in 1530. It is an
enormous quarto of over a thousand pages, full of elaborate,
detailed and often obscure rules, written in English in spite
of the French title. It was no doubt the solid value and
exhaustiveness of Palsgrave's work which won for it the
reputation of being the earliest grammar of the French
language.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Yet Palsgrave himself informs us that such was
not the case, though he claims to be the first to lay down
'absolute' rules for the language.</p>

<p>The kings of England, he declares, have never ceased
to encourage "suche clerkes as were in theyr tymes, to
prove and essay what they by theyr dylygence in this
matter myght do." "This like charge," he continues, "have
dyvers others had afore my dayes ... many sondrie clerkes
have for their tyme taken theyr penne in hande.... Some
thyng have they in writing lefte behynde them concerning
into this mater, for the ease and furtheraunce as well of suche
as shilde in lyke charge after them succede, as of them whiche
from tyme to tyme in that tong were to be instructed ... takyng
light and erudition of theyr studious labours whiche
in this matter before me have taken paynes to write.... I
dyd my effectuall devoire to ensertche out suche bokes as
had by others of this mater before my tyme ben compyled,
of which undouted, after enquery and ensertche made for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-4-</a></span>them dyvers came into my handes as well suche whose authors
be yet amongst us lyveng, as suche whiche were of this mater
by other sondrie persons longe afore my dayes composed."</p>

<p>The living predecessors to whom Palsgrave refers&mdash;authors
of short works of small philological value, but of great interest
to-day as evidence of the wide use of the French language
in England&mdash;were likewise acquainted with earlier works on
the subject. Giles Duwes, tutor in French to Henry VIII.
and other members of the royal family, frequently invokes
the authority of the 'olde grammar.' The poet Alexander
Barclay, in his French Grammar of 1521, informs us that
"the said treatyse hath ben attempted of dyvers men before
my dayes," and that he had "sene the draughtes of others"
made before his time; moreover, in times past, the French
language "hath ben so moche set by in England that who
hath ben ignorant in the same language hath not ben reputed
to be of gentyll blode. In so moche that, as the cronycles
of englande recorde, in all the gramer scoles throughout
englande small scolars expounded theyr construccyons bothe
in Frenche and Englysshe."</p>

<p>Thus the French grammarians in England in the early
sixteenth century were acquainted with, and to some extent
indebted to, a series of mediaeval treatises on the French
language,&mdash;a type of work which, even at the time they wrote,
was unknown on the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That England, before
other countries, took on herself the study of the French
language, was the result of events which followed the Conquest.
From that time French had taken its place by the side of
English as a vernacular. It was the language of the upper
classes and landed gentry, the cultivated and educated;
English was used by the masses, while all who read and wrote
knew Latin, the language of clerks and scholars. For nearly
three centuries after the Conquest almost all writings of any
literary value produced in England were in French, though
the bulk of composition was in Latin; English never ceased
to be written, but was used in minor works for the most
part.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, to find that from an early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-5-</a></span>date Latin was at times construed or translated into French<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
as well as English in the grammar schools, both languages
serving as vernaculars. There are still extant examples of
this custom,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> dating from the twelfth century; for instance,
a version of the psalter, in which the French words are placed
above the Latin without any regard to the order of the
French sentence.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Others are found in some of the first
vocabularies written for the purpose of teaching Latin,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which
consist of lists of words grouped round subjects and arranged,
as a rule, in sentence form. Two of these works seem to have
been particularly well known, judging from the number of
manuscripts still in existence&mdash;those of the English scholars,
Alexander Neckam (1157-1217) and John de Garlande, both
of whom were indebted to France for most of their learning.
Neckam, who in 1180 had attained celebrity as a Professor of
the University of Paris, was the author of a Latin Vocabulary&mdash;<i>De
Utensilibus</i>&mdash;which was glossed in Anglo-French.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In
this he enumerates the various parts of a house and the occupations
and callings of men, and gives scenes from feudal and
agricultural life. The <i>Dictionarius</i> (<i>c.</i> 1220) of John de Garlande,
a student of Oxford and Paris, and one of the first professors
of Toulouse University, deals roughly with the same
topics.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It is glossed in both French and English&mdash;the sign of
a later period&mdash;as was also a Latin vocabulary or <i>nominale</i>
of the names of plants,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> dating from a little later in the same
century, though probably existing in earlier manuscripts.</p>

<p>At the universities a decided preference for French was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-6-</a></span>shown in the rare occasions on which the use of a vernacular
was allowed. The speaking of French was encouraged in
some of the colleges at both Oxford and Cambridge, chiefly
those belonging to the second set of foundations.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
scholars and fellows of Oriel could use either Latin or French
in their familiar conversation and at meals. Similar injunctions
were in force at Exeter and Queen's. Among the
Cambridge colleges<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the statutes of Peterhouse allow French
to be used for "just and reasonable cause"; at King's it
was permitted on occasion, and at Clare Hall French was
countenanced only if foreigners were present as visitors. At
Pembroke, founded by a Frenchwoman, Mary de Valence,
special favour was shown to Frenchmen in the election of
Fellows, provided that their total number did not exceed a
quarter of the whole body.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The cosmopolitanism of the
mediaeval centres of learning encouraged a number of such
French students to come to England. In 1259, for instance,
owing to the disturbed state of the University of Paris,
Henry III. invited the Paris students to come to England and
take up their abode wheresoever they pleased;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> no doubt
those who accepted his invitation settled at one or other of
the two English universities. We also find in the Treaty of
Bretigny (1360) a clause to the effect that the subjects of the
French and English kings should henceforth be free to resume
their intercourse and to enjoy mutually the privileges of the
universities of the two countries, "comme ils povoient faire
avant ces presentes guerres et comme ils font a present."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
On the other hand, the English frequented the French universities
in large numbers; at Paris in the thirteenth century
they formed one of the four nations which composed the
University.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The authors of the early Latin vocabularies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-7-</a></span>Alexander Neckam and John de Garlande, were both connected
with the University of Paris, while most of the other
English scholars of the period were indebted for much of
their learning to the same great centre. Many, no doubt,
could have written with Garlande:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Anglia cui mater fuerat, cui Gallia nutrix<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matri nutricem praefero mente meam.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the thirteenth century French was still widely used in
England. The fact that the fusion between conquerors and
conquered was then complete,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and that at the same time
French was very popular on the Continent undoubtedly helped
to make its position in England stronger. It was then that the
Italian Brunetto Latini wrote his <i>Livres dou Tresor</i> (1265), in
French rather than in his native tongue, because French
was "plus delitable et plus commune à toutes gens." During
the same century French came to be used in correspondence
on both sides of the Channel.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Little by little it was
recognized as the most convenient medium for official uses,
and the language most generally known in these sections
of society which had to administer justice.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In the
second half of the thirteenth century Robert of Gloucester
complained that there was no land "that holdeth not to its
kindly speech save Englonde only," admitting at the same
time, however, that ignorance of French was a serious disadvantage.
An idea of the extent to which the language was
current in England may be gathered from the fact that
in 1301 Edward I. caused letters from the Pope to be translated
into French so that they might be understood by the
whole army,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and in the previous year the author of the
<i>Miroir des Justices</i> wrote in French as being the language
"le plus entendable de la comun people." French, indeed,
appears to have been used among all classes, save the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-8-</a></span>very poorest;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> some of the French literature of the time
was addressed more particularly to the middle classes.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the thirteenth century advanced, French
began to hold its own with some difficulty. While it was in
the unusual position of a vernacular gradually losing its
power as such, there appeared the earliest extant treatise on
the language. This, and those that followed it, were to some
extent lessons in the vernacular; yet not entirely, as may be
judged from the fact that they are set forth and explained
in Latin, the language of all scholarship. The first work on
the French language, dating from not later than the middle of
the thirteenth century, is in the form of a short Latin treatise
on French conjugations,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in which a comparison of the French
with the Latin tenses is instituted.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> As it appeared at a
time when French was becoming the literary language of the
law, and was being used freely in correspondence, it may have
been intended mainly for the use of clerks. A treatise of
considerably more importance composed towards the end of
the century, appears to have had the same purpose. That
he did not intend it exclusively for clerks, however, the
author showed by adding rules for pronunciation, syntax
and even morphology as well as for orthography. Like most
of the early grammatical writings on the French language,
this <i>Orthographia Gallica</i> is in Latin. The obscurity of
many of its rules, however, called forth commentaries in
French which appeared during the fourteenth century, and
exceed the size of the original work. The <i>Orthographia</i> was
a very popular work, as the number of manuscripts extant
and the French commentary prove. The different copies
vary considerably, and there is a striking increase in the
number of rules given; from being about thirty in the
earliest manuscript, they number about a hundred in the
latest.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">-9-</a></span>It opens with a rule that when the first or middle
syllable of a French word contains a short <i>e</i>, <i>i</i> must be
placed before the <i>e</i>, as in <i>bien</i>, <i>rien</i>, etc.&mdash;a curious, fumbling
attempt to explain the development of Latin free short <i>e</i>
before nasals and oral consonants into <i>ie</i>. On the other hand,
continues the author, <i>e</i> acute need not be preceded by <i>i</i>, as
<i>tenez</i>. It is not surprising that these early writers, in spite
of much patient observation, should almost always have
failed to grasp fundamental laws, and group a series of corresponding
facts into the form of a general rule. We continually
find rules drawn up for a few isolated examples, with no
general application. The most striking feature in the treatment
of French orthography in this work is the continual
reference to Latin roots, and the clear statement of the
principle that, wherever possible, the spelling of French words
should be based on that of Latin.</p>

<p>The <i>Orthographia</i> does not by any means limit its observations
to spelling; there are also rules for pronunciation, a
subject which in later times naturally held a very important
place in French grammars written for the use of Englishmen,
while orthography became one of the chief concerns of French
grammarians. That orthography received so much attention
at this early period in this country, is explained by the fact
that these manuals were partly intended for "clerks," who
would frequently have to write in French. As to the pronunciation,
we find, amongst others, the familiar rule that
when a French word ending in a consonant comes before
another word beginning with a consonant, the first consonant
is not pronounced. An <i>s</i> occurring after a vowel and before
an <i>m</i>, writes the author, in another rule, is not pronounced,
as in <i>mandasmes</i>, and <i>l</i> coming after <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, or <i>o</i>, and followed
by a consonant is pronounced like <i>u</i>, as in <i>m'almi</i>, <i>loialment</i>,
and the like. A list of synonyms<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> is also given, which throws
some light on the English pronunciation of French at this
period, and there are also a few hints for the translation of
both Latin and English into French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-10-</a></span>Nor are syntax and morphology neglected; rules concerning
these are scattered among those on orthography and
pronunciation, with the lack of orderly arrangement characteristic
of the whole work. Thus we are told to use <i>me</i>
in the accusative case, and <i>moy</i> in all other cases; that we
should form the plural of verbs ending in <i>t</i> in the singular by
adding <i>z</i>, as <i>il amet</i>, <i>il list</i> become <i>vous amez</i>, <i>vous lisez</i>; that
when we ask any one for something, we may say <i>vous pri</i>
without <i>je</i>, but that, when we do this, we should write <i>pri</i>
with a <i>y</i>, as <i>pry</i>, and so on.</p>

<p>The claim of the <i>Orthographia Gallica</i> to be the first extant
work on French orthography, has been disputed by another
treatise, also written in Latin, and known as the <i>Tractatus
Orthographiae</i>. More methodically arranged than the <i>Orthographia</i>,
this work deals more particularly with pronunciation
and orthography.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It opens with a short introduction
announcing that here are the means for the youth of the time
to make their way in the world speedily and learn French
pronunciation and orthography. Each letter of the alphabet
is first treated in turn,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and then come a few more general
observations. Like the author of the <i>Orthographia</i>, the writer
of the <i>Tractatus</i> would have the spelling of French words based
on that of Latin whenever possible. He claims that his own
French is "secundum dulce Gallicum" and "secundum usum
et modum modernorum tam partibus transmarinis quam
cismarinis." Though he apparently places the French of
England and the French of France on the same footing, it is
noteworthy that he carefully distinguishes between the two.</p>

<p>The <i>Tractatus Orthographiae</i> bears a striking resemblance
to another work of like nature, which is better known&mdash;the
<i>Tractatus Orthographiae</i> of Canon M. T. Coyfurelly, doctor
in Law of Orleans<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;and for some time it was thought to be
merely a rehandling of Coyfurelly's treatise which did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-11-</a></span>appear till somewhere about the end of the fourteenth century,
if not later. But Coyfurelly admits that his work was based
on the labours of one 'T. H. Parisii Studentis,' and there
appears, on examination,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> to be no doubt as to the priority
of the anonymous <i>Tractatus</i> described above, which, on the
contrary, is evidently the treatise rehandled by Coyfurelly,
and the work of 'T. H. Student of Paris.' Besides being the
original which Coyfurelly recast in his <i>Tractatus</i>, it also
appears that T. H. may reasonably dispute with the author
of the <i>Orthographia Gallica</i>, the honour of being the first in
the field. His work shows no advance on the rules given
for pronunciation in the <i>Orthographia</i>, while the orthography
is of a decidedly older stamp.</p>

<p>At about the same time as these two treatises on orthography,
probably a few years earlier, there was composed
a work of similar purpose but very different character. It is
of particular interest, and shows that, towards the end of
the thirteenth century, French was beginning to be treated
as a foreign language; the French is accompanied by a
partial English gloss, and the author states that "touz dis
troverez-vous primes le Frauncois et pus le Engleys suaunt."
The author, Gautier or Walter de Bibbesworth,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> was an Englishman,
and appears to have mixed with the best society of the
day. He was a friend of the celebrated statesman of the
reign of Edward I., Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln. The
only work by which his name is known to-day, in addition to
the treatise in question, is a short piece of Anglo-Norman
verse,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> written on the occasion of the expedition of Edward I.
to the Holy Land in 1270, shortly before he came to the throne.
We gather from letters of protection granted him in that year
that Bibbesworth himself took part in this venture. In this
poem he is pictured discussing the Crusade with Lacy,
and trying to persuade his friend to take part in it. The
name of Bibbesworth also occurs several times<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">-12-</a></span>documents of no special interest, and as late as 1302 a writ
of Privy Seal was addressed to the Chancellor suing for a
pardon under the Great Seal to W. de Bibbesworth, in consideration
of his good services rendered in Scotland, for a
breach of the park of Robert de Seales at Ravenhall, and of
the king's prison at Colchester.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Bibbesworth, however, interests us less as a crusader or a
disturber of public order, than as the author of a treatise for
teaching the French language, entitled <i>Le Treytyz qe mounsire
Gauter de Bibelesworthe fist a ma dame Dyonisie de Mounchensy<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
pur aprise de langwage</i>. The large number of manuscripts still
in existence<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> suggest that it was a popular text-book among
the children of the higher classes of society. The treatise
reproduces, as might be expected, the chief characteristics of
the vocabularies for teaching Latin. In addition to giving a
collection of words and phrases arranged in the form of a
narrative, it also incidentally aims at imparting some slight
grammatical information. Its contents are of a very practical
character, and deal exclusively with the occurrences
and occupations of daily life. Beginning with the new-born
child, it tells in French verses how it is to be nursed and fed.
Rime was no doubt introduced to aid the memory, as the
pupil would, in all probability, have to learn the whole by heart.
The French is accompanied by a partial interlinear English gloss,
giving the equivalent of the more difficult French words. This
may, perhaps, be taken as an indication of the extent to
which French was regarded as a foreign language.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>After describing the life of the child during its earliest
infancy, Bibbesworth goes on to tell how it is to be taught
French as soon as it can speak, "that it may be better learned
in speach and held up to scorn by none":</p>

<p class="noi">In accordance with this programme the parts of the human
body, which almost invariably forms the central theme in
this type of manual, are enumerated. Special care is taken to
distinguish the genders and cases, to teach the children "Kaunt
deivunt dire <i>moun</i> et <i>ma</i>, <i>soun</i> et <i>sa</i>, <i>le</i> et <i>la</i>, <i>moy</i> et <i>jo</i> . . .,"
and to explain how the meaning of words of similar sound
often depends on their gender:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><i>lippe and an hare</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vous avet la levere et le levere,<br /></span>
<span class="i05"><i>a pound</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a book</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et la livere et le livere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La levere si enclost les dens;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le levere en boys se tent dedens;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La livere sert en marchaundye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le livere nous aprent clergye.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Throughout Bibbesworth seizes every opportunity to point
out distinctions of gender of this kind, regardless, it appears,
of the difference between the definite and indefinite articles.
When the pupil can describe his body, the teacher proceeds
to give him an account of "all that concerns it both inside
and out" ("kaunt ke il apent dedens et deores"), that is of
its clothing and food:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vestet vos draps mes chers enfauns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chaucez vos brays, soulers, e gauns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mettet le chaperoun, covrez le chef, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">&mdash;a passage which illustrates the practical nature of the
treatise, Bibbesworth's aim being to teach children to know
the properties of the things they see ("les propretez des
choses ke veyunt").</p>

<p>When the child is clothed, Bibbesworth next feeds him,
giving a full account of the meals and the food which is
provided, and, by way of variety, at the end of the dinner,
he teaches his pupil the names given to groups of different
animals, and of the verbs used to describe their various cries.
("Homme parle, cheval hennist," etc.). By this time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">-14-</a></span>
child is ready to observe Nature, and to learn the terms of
husbandry,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and the processes by which his food is produced.
From the fields he passes to the woods and the river, where
he learns to hunt and to fish, subjects which naturally lead
to the introduction of the French names of the seasons,
and of the beasts and birds that are supposed to present
themselves to his view.</p>

<p>During the whole of this long category the verse form is maintained,
and the intention of avoiding a vocabulary pure and
simple is manifest. How superior this method was to the more
modern lists of words separated from the context is also
evident. Besides giving a description of all the objects with
which the child comes in contact, and of all the actions he has
to perform, as well as examples for the distinctions of genders
and of <i>moy</i> and <i>jo</i>&mdash;difficulties for which he makes no attempts
to draw up rules&mdash;Bibbesworth claims for his work that it
provides gentlemen with adequate instruction for conversational
purposes ("tot le ordre en parler e respoundre ke
checun gentyshomme covent saver"). And as he did not
wish to neglect any of the items of daily life, he finally gives
a description of the building of a house and various domestic
arrangements, ending with a description of an old English
feast with its familiar dish, the boar's head:</p>

<p>As time went on a conscious effort was made to retain the
use of the French language in England. Higden, writing at
about the middle of the fourteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> informs us that
English was then neglected for two reasons: "One is bycause
that children than gon to schole lerne to speke first Englysshe
and then ben compelled constrewe ther lessons in Frenssh";
"Also gentilmens children ben lerned and taught from theyr
yougthe to speke frenssh.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> And uplandish men will counterfete
and likene them self to gentilmen and arn besy to speke
frensshe for to be more sette by. Wherefor it is sayd by a
common proverbe Jack wold be a gentilmen if he coude
speke frensshe."</p>

<p>At the University of Oxford, likewise, the Grammar masters
were enjoined to teach the boys to construe in English and
in French, "so that the latter language be not forgotten."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
The same university gave some slight encouragement to the
study of French. There were special teachers who, although
not enjoying the privileges of those lecturing in the usual
academic subjects, were none the less recognised by the
University. They had to observe the Statutes, and to promise
not to give their lessons at times which would interfere with
the ordinary lectures in arts. The French teachers were
under the superintendence of the masters of grammar, and
had to pay thirteen shillings a year to the Masters in Arts
to compensate them for any disadvantage they might suffer
from any loss of pupils; if there was only one teacher of French
he had to pay the whole amount himself. As for those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">-16-</a></span>learning "to write, to compose, and speak French," they had
to attend lectures in rhetoric and grammar&mdash;the courses most
akin to their studies<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;and to contribute to the maintenance
of the lecturers in these subjects, there being no ordinary
lectures in French.</p>

<p>In the meantime, more treatises for teaching French
appeared; Bibbesworth's book soon found imitators, and early
in the new century an anonymous author, clearly an Englishman,
made free use of Bibbesworth in a treatise called <i>The
Nominale sive Verbale in Gallicis cum expositione ejusdem in
Anglicis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This anonymous writer<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> however, thought it
necessary to make the interlinear English gloss much fuller
than Bibbesworth had done, which shows that French had
become more of a foreign language in the interval between
the two works. He also placed the English rendering after
the French, instead of above it. The later work differs
further from the earlier in the order of the subject headings,
as well as by the introduction of a few new topics. Enumerating
the parts of the body,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> as Bibbesworth had done, the
author proceeds to make his most considerable addition to
the subjects introduced by Bibbesworth in describing "la
noyse et des faitz que homme naturalment fait":</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">
<div><div lang="fr"><span class="i2">Homme parle et espire:</span></div>
<div><span class="i2"><i>Man spekyth &amp; vndyth.</i></span></div></div>
<div><div lang="fr"><span class="i2">Femme teinge et suspire:</span></div>
<div><span class="i2"><i>Woman pantyth &amp; syketh.</i></span></div></div>
<div><div lang="fr"><span class="i2">Homme bale et babeie:</span></div>
<div><span class="i2"><i>Man dravelith &amp; wlaffyth.</i></span></div></div>
<div><div lang="fr"><span class="i2">Femme bale et bleseie:</span></div>
<div><i>Woman galpyth &amp; wlispyth.</i></div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>He then describes all the daily actions and occupations of
men:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">
<div><div lang="fr">Homme va a la herce:</div>
<div><i>Man goth at the harewe.</i></div></div>
<div><div lang="fr">Femme bercelet berce:</div>
<div><i>Woman childe in cradel rokkith....</i></div></div>
<div><div lang="fr">Enfant sa lessone reherce:</div>
<div><span class="i4"><i>His lessone recordeth</i>,</span></div></div></blockquote>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">-17-</a></span>and so on for about 350 lines. Other additions are of little
importance, and, for the rest, the author treats subjects first
introduced by Bibbesworth, though the wording often differs
to a certain extent.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>When, towards the end of the thirteenth century, French
began to be used in correspondence, need for instruction in
French epistolary art arose; and early in the fourteenth
century guides to letter-writing in French, in the form of
epistolaries or collections of model letters, were produced.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
The letters themselves are given in French, but the accompanying
rules and instructions for composing them are in
Latin. French and Latin have changed rôles; in earlier times
Latin had been explained to school children by means of
French. Forms for addressing members of the different grades
of society are supplied, from epistles to the king and high
state and ecclesiastical dignitaries down to commercial letters
for merchants, and familiar ones for private individuals.
Women, too, were not forgotten; we find similar examples
covering the same range&mdash;from the queen and the ladies of
the nobility to her more humble subjects. Each letter is
almost invariably followed by its answer, likewise in French.
Some contain interesting references to the great men or events
of the day, but those of a more private nature possess a greater
attraction, and throw light on the family life of the age. A
letter from a mother to her son at school may be quoted:<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>From about the middle of the fourteenth century a feeling
of discontent with the prerogative of the French language in
England becomes prominent. The loss of the greater part
of the French possessions, and the continued state of hostilities
with France during the reign of Edward III. brought home
forcibly to the English mind the fact that the French were
a distinct nation, and French a foreign tongue. This tardy
recovery is sufficient proof of the strong resistance which had
to be overcome. Chaucer is the greatest representative of the
new movement. "Let Frenchmen endite their quaint terms
in French," he exclaims, "for it is kindly to their mouths,
but let us show our fantaisies in suche words as we learned
from our dames' tongues." His contemporary, Gower, was
less quick to discern the signs of the times. Of the four
volumes of his works, two are in Latin, one in French, and
one in English; but the order in which he uses these languages
is instructive&mdash;first French, then Latin, and lastly
English. Some writers made a compromise by employing
a mixture of French and English.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> French, however,
continued to hold an important place in prose writings until
the middle of the fifteenth century; but such works are of
little literary value. The reign of French as the literary
language of England, as Chaucer had been quick to discern,
was approaching its end.</p>

<p>The same period is marked by a growing disrespect for
Anglo-French as compared with the French of France. The
French of England, cut off from the living source, had developed
apart, and often with more rapidity than the other
French dialects on the Continent. What is more, the
language brought by the invaders was not a pure form
of the Norman dialect; men from various parts of France
had joined in William's expedition. The invaders, always
called 'French' by their contemporaries, brought in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">-19-</a></span>strong Picard element; and in the twelfth century there
was a similar Angevin influence. Moreover, during Norman
and Angevin times, craftsmen and others immigrated to
England, each bringing with him the dialectal peculiarities
of his own province.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Thus no regular development of Anglo-French
was possible, and it can hardly be regarded as an
ordinary dialect, notwithstanding its literary importance.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
This disparity in the quality of Anglo-French is illustrated
in a remarkable way by the literature of the period. Those
who had received special educational advantages, or had
travelled on the Continent, spoke and wrote French correctly;
others used forms which contrasted pitiably with continental
French. Moreover, the fourteenth century saw the triumph
of the Île de France dialect in France; the other dialects
ceased, as a rule, to be used in literature,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and this change
was not without effect on Anglo-French, which shared
their degradation. Chaucer lets us know the poor opinion
he had of the French of England; his Prioress speaks French
"full fayre and fetisly," but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For French of Paris was to her unknowe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">William Langland admits that he knew "no frenche in feith,
but of the ferthest ende of Norfolke."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> As early as the
thirteenth century English writers had felt bound to apologize
as Englishmen for their French. Nor were their excuses
superfluous in many cases; William of Wadington, the author
of the <i>Manuel des Pechiez</i>, for example, wrote:<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">De le françois ne del rimer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Car en Engleterre fu né<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et nurri lenz et ordiné.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Such apologies became all the more necessary as time went on.
Even Gower, whose French was comparatively pure,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> owing
no doubt to travel in France in early life, deemed it advisable
to explain that he wrote in French for "tout le monde en
general," and to ask pardon if he has not "de François la
faconde":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jeo suis Englois si quier par tiele voie<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">-20-</a></span>
<span class="i0">Estre excusé.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">At about the same time the anonymous author of the <i>Testament
of Love</i> finds fault with the English for their persistence in
writing in bad French, "of which speech the Frenchmen
have as good a fantasy as we have in hearing of Frenchmen's
English."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The notoriety of the French of Englishmen reached France.
Indeed this was a time when the English were more generally
known in France than they were to be for several hundreds
of years afterwards&mdash;until the eighteenth century. Englishmen
filled positions in their possessions in France, and during
the long wars between the two countries in the reign of
Edward III., many of the English nobility resided in that
country with their families. Montaigne refers to traces of
the English in Guyenne, which still remained in the sixteenth
century: "Il est une nation," he writes in one of his Essays,
"a laquelle ceux de mon quartier ont eu autrefois si privée
accointance qu'il reste encore en ma maison aucune trace de
leur ancien cousinage."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The opinions formed by the French
of the English were naturally anything but flattering. We
find them expressed in songs of the time.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> But the recriminations
were mutual, and the English had already hit upon the
epithet which for centuries they applied to Frenchmen, and
most other foreigners indiscriminately:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Franche dogue dit un Anglois.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vous ne faites que boire vin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si faisons bien dist le François,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mais vous buvez le lunnequin. (bière.)<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Even in the <i>Roman de Renart</i> we come across traces of
familiarity with English ways, and also of the English
language.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that Anglo-French was a subject
of remark in France, especially when we remember that
already in the thirteenth century the provincial accents of
the different parts of France herself had been the object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-21-</a></span>some considerable amount of raillery.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The English, says
Froissart, a good judge, for he spent many years in England,
"disoient bien que le françois que ils avoient apris chies eulx
d'enfance n'estoit pas de telle nature et condition que celluy
de France estoit."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> And this 'condition' was soon recognized
as a plentiful store for facetious remarks and parodies
of all kinds. In the <i>Roman de Jehan et Blonde</i>, the young
Frenchman's rival, the Duke of Gloucester, is made to appear
ridiculous by speaking bad French; and one of the tricks
played by Renart on Ysengrin, in the <i>Roman de Renart</i>, is to
pretend he is an Englishman:<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ez vos Renart qui le salue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Godehelpe," fait il, "bel Sire!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non saver point ton reson dire."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">And Ysengrin answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Et dex saut vos, bau dous amis!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dont estes vos? de quel pais?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vous n'estes mie nés de France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne de la nostre connoissance.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">A <i>fabliau</i> of the fourteenth century<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> pictures the dilemma
of two Englishmen trying to make their French understood
in France; one of them is ill and would have some lamb:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Si tu avez un anel cras<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mi porra bien mengier ce croi.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">His friend sets out to try to get the 'anel' or 'lamb'; but
no one understands him, and he becomes the laughing-stock
of the villagers. At last some one gives him a 'small donkey'
instead of the desired 'agnel,' and out of this he makes a
dish for the invalid who finds the bones rather large. In the
face of a reputation such as this it is no wonder that the
English found additional encouragement to abandon the
foreign language and cultivate their own tongue.</p>

<p>English was also beginning to make its way into official
documents.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In 1362 the King's Speech at the opening of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">-22-</a></span>Parliament was pronounced in English, and in the following
year it was directed that all pleas in the courts of justice
should be pleaded and judged in English, because French
was "trope desconue en ledit realme." Despite that, the
act was very tardily obeyed, and English progressed but
slowly, French continuing to be written long after it ceased
to be spoken in the Law Courts. There were a few public
documents issued in English at the end of the century, but
the Acts and Records of Parliament continued to be written
in French for many years subsequently. English first made
its way into the operative parts of the Statutes, and till 1503
the formal parts were still written in French and Latin.
Protests were made to Henry VIII. against the continued
use of French, "as thereby ys testyfied our subjectyon to
the Normannys"; yet it was not before the eighteenth
century that English was exclusively used in the Law Courts,
and for many years French, in its corrupt form, remained the
literary language of the English law. Till the seventeenth
century works on jurisprudence and reports on cases were
mainly written in French. <i>Les Cases de Gray's Inn</i> shows
French in accounts of discussions on difficult legal cases as
late as 1680.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Sir John Fortescue (1394?-1476), Lord Chief
Justice of the King's Bench, in his <i>De Laudibus Legum Angliae</i>,
suggests that this Law French is more correct at bottom than
ordinary spoken French, which, he contends, is much "altered
by common use, whereas Law French is more often writ than
spoken." In later times no such illusions prevailed. Swift
thus estimates the value of the three languages of the English
Law:<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="noi">At about the same time as Swift wrote, the 'frenchified' Lady,
then in fashion, who prided herself on her knowledge of the
"language à la mode" is described as being able to "keep the
field against a whole army of Lawyers, and that in their own
language, French gibberish."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> And long after French ceased
to be used in the Law many law terms and legal and official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">-23-</a></span>phrases remained, and are still in use to-day.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Anglo-French
also lingered in some of the religious houses after it had fallen
into discredit elsewhere, and continued to do so in some cases
till the time of their dissolution. The rules and accounts of
the nunneries were more often in French than not.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> And
John ap Rhys, visitor of monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII.,
wrote to Cromwell regarding the monastery of Laycock in
Wiltshire, that he had observed one thing "worthy th'advertisement;
the ladies have their Rule, th'institutes of their
Religion and the ceremonies of the same written in the
Frenche tongue, which they understand well and are very
perfyt in the same, albeit that it varieth from vulgar Frenche
that is now used, and is moche like the Frenche that the
common Lawe is written in."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>During this same period English began to be used occasionally
in correspondence; but here again its progress was slow.
Some idea of the extent to which French was utilized for that
purpose may be gathered from the fact that three extant
letters of William de Wykeham, addressed to Englishmen,
are all in that tongue. Not till the second and third decades
of the fifteenth century were English and French employed
in correspondence to an almost equal extent, and during the
following years, especially in the reign of Henry VI., English
gradually became predominant.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> French remained in use
longer in correspondence of a public and official nature, but
became more and more restricted to foreign diplomacy.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the fourteenth century, at the
beginning of the long wars with France, French lost ground
in England in yet another direction. Edward III. is
said to have found it necessary to proclaim that all lords,
barons, knights, burgesses, should see that their children
learn French for political and military reasons;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">-24-</a></span>Trevisa translated Higden's <i>Polychronicon</i>, he wrote in correction
of the earlier chronicler's description of the teaching of
French in the grammar schools of England:<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> "This maner
was moche used before the grete deth (1349). But syth it is
somdele chaunged. Now (<i>i.e.</i> 1387) they leave all Frensch
in scholes, and use all construction in Englisch. Wherin they
have advantage on way that they lerne the soner ther gramer.
And in another disadvantage. For nowe they lerne no
Frenssh ne can none, whiche is hurte for them that shall passe
the see," and thus children of the grammar schools know "no
more French than knows their lefte heele."</p>

<p>Thus the custom of translating Latin into French passed
out of use early in the second half of the fourteenth century.
No doubt there had been signs of the approaching change
in the preceding period, and it is of interest here to notice that
while Neckham's Latin vocabulary, which dates from the second
half of the twelfth century, is glossed in French alone, that
of Garlande, which belongs approximately to the third decade
of the following century, is accompanied by translations in
both French and English. In the universities, however, where
French had been slower in gaining a foothold, it remained
longer; in the fifteenth century teachers of French were still
allowed to lecture there as they had done previously, but it
is to be noticed that in all the colleges founded after the Black
Death (1349), from which the change in the grammar schools
is dated, the regulations encouraging the speaking of French
in Hall are absent. The change appears also to have affected
the higher classes, who did not usually frequent the grammar
schools and universities, but depended on more private
methods of instruction. Trevisa here again adds a correction
to the earlier chronicle, and informs us that "gentylmen
haveth now myche lefte for to teach their children Frensch."</p>

<p>We thus witness the gradual disappearance of the effects
of the Norman Conquest in the history of the use of the
French language in England. The Conquest had made
Norman-French the language of the Court, and to some extent,
of the Church; it had brought with it a French literature
which nearly smothered the national literature and replaced
it temporarily; it had led to the system of translating Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">-25-</a></span>into French as well as into English in the schools. In the later
fourteenth century French was no longer the chief language
of the Court, and the king spoke English and was addressed
in the same tongue. In the Church the employment of
French had been restricted and transitory, though, as has
been mentioned, it lingered in some of the monasteries until
the sixteenth century; yet Latin never found in it a serious
rival in this sphere, and the ecclesiastical department of
the law never followed the civil in the adoption of the use of
French. How French lost ground in the other spheres has
already been traced: in all these cases its employment may
be regarded as a direct result of the Conquest.</p>

<p>This great event had also indirect results. French became
the official language of England, and the favourite medium
of correspondence in the thirteenth century, when the fusion
between the two races was complete. But it is highly improbable
that French would have spread in these directions
if the Conquest had not in the first place made French the
vernacular of a considerable portion of Englishmen, and that
the most influential. With its use in official documents and in
correspondence, may be classed the slight encouragement
French received at Oxford. In all these spheres it remained
longer than it had done where its status had been a more
direct result of the Conquest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the desire to cultivate and imitate the French
of France had been growing stronger and stronger; and
when, towards the end of the fourteenth century, the older
influences were getting feebler, and in some cases had
passed away, the influence of the continental French,
especially the French of Paris, now supreme over the other
dialects, became more and more marked. And it is this
language which henceforth Englishmen strove to learn,
gradually relinquishing the corrupt idiom with which for so
long their name had been associated.</p>

<h3>THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">These</span> great changes which took place in the status of French
in England did not, however, affect fundamentally the popularity
of the language: they had to do with Anglo-French alone.
French, as distinct from this and as a foreign language, received
more attention than ever before, especially from the higher
classes, and from travellers and merchants. It was the language
of politeness and refinement in the eyes of Englishmen, not
only as a result of the Conquest, but for its inherent qualities;
and so it retained this position when it gave way to English
or Latin in other spheres where its predominance had been
due, either directly or indirectly, to the Conquest. French
had enjoyed a social reputation in England before the arrival
of the invaders,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and had already made some progress towards
becoming the language which the English loved and cultivated
above all modern foreign tongues, and to which they
devoted for a great many years more care than they did
to their own. "Doulz françois," writes an Englishman at
the end of the fourteenth century in a treatise for teaching
the language,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> is the most beautiful and gracious language in
the world, after the Latin of the schools,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> "et de tous gens
mieulx prisée et amée que nul autre; quar Dieu le fist se
doulce et amiable principalement a l'oneur et loenge de luy
mesmes. Et pour ce il peut bien comparer au parler des
angels du ciel, pour la grant doulceur et biaultée d'icel"&mdash;a
more eloquent tribute even than the more famous lines of
Brunetto Latini. Another writer of the same period informs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">-27-</a></span>us that "les bones gens du Roiaume d'Engleterre sont
embrasez a scavoir lire et escrire, entendre et parler droit
François," and that he himself thinks it is very necessary for
the English to know the "droict nature de François," for
many reasons.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> For instance, that they may enjoy intercourse
with their neighbours, the good folk of the kingdom of France;
that they may better understand the laws of England, of
which a great many are still written in French; and also
because "beaucoup de bones choses sont misez en François,"
and the lords and ladies of England are very fond of writing
to each other in the same tongue.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>As a result of the altered circumstances which were modifying
the attitude of the English, there is a corresponding
change in the standard of the French which the manuals for
teaching that language sought to attain. All the best text-books
of the end of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries endeavour
with few exceptions to impart a knowledge of the French of
Paris, "doux françois de Paris" or "la droite language de
Paris," as it was called, in contrast with the French of Stratford-atte-Bowe
and other parts of England. Those authors
of treatises for teaching French of whose lives we have any
details, had studied French in France, at Paris, Orleans, or
some other University town. The fact that many of their
productions still contain numbers of words belonging to the
Norman and other dialects does not diminish the importance
and significance of their more ambitious aims. These
pioneer works on the French language, written in England
by Englishmen without the guidance of any similar work
produced in France, were bound to contain archaisms as
well as anglicisms.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Fluency in speaking French was the chief need of the
classes of society in which the demand for instruction was
greatest. Correctness in detail was only of secondary importance,
and grammar, though desirable, was not considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">-28-</a></span>indispensable. The importance of speaking French naturally
brought the subject of pronunciation to the fore. No
doubt most of the early teachers shared the opinions of
their successors, that rules and theoretical information were
of little avail in teaching the sounds of the language, compared
with the practice of imitation and repetition; nevertheless,
many of them attempted to supply some information on the
subject. When, in the second decade of the fifteenth century,
another writer based a new treatise for teaching French on
the vocabulary of Bibbesworth, which had then been current
for well over a century, the chief point in which it differed
from its original was precisely in the provision of guidance
to facilitate pronunciation.</p>

<p>This new treatise was styled <i>Femina</i>,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> because just as the
mother teaches her young child to speak his native tongue,
so does this work teach children to speak French naturally.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
It covers almost exactly the same ground as the vocabulary
of Bibbesworth, but, as in the case of the earlier imitation of
the same work, the <i>Nominale</i>, the order of arrangement varies,
and the whole is permeated with a lively humour which makes
it at least equal in interest to the work on which it is based.
The French lines are octosyllabic and arranged in distichs,
each pair being followed by an English translation, which is
given in full, contrary to the practice in the earlier works of
the same kind. The author endeavours to teach the French
of France<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> as distinguished from that of England, and,
although he lavishes provincialisms from the local dialects of
France&mdash;Norman, Picard, Walloon&mdash;in the main they are
French provincialisms, and many of them may be due to
errors on the part of the scribe. To assist pronunciation notes
are provided at the bottom of the page, giving pseudo-English
equivalents of the sounds of words written otherwise in the text.</p>

<p>The treatise opens with an exhortation to the child to
learn French that he may speak fairly before wise men, for
"heavy is he that is not taught":</p>

The concluding chapter, "De moribus infantis," is taken
from another source, and gives admonitions for discreet
behaviour, quoting the moral treatise of the pseudo-Cato,
the Proverbs of Solomon, and the like. The passage in which
<i>Femina</i> deals with the upbringing of the child may be of
interest, as showing how the later author repeats the earlier,
while altering the wording; and as throwing some light on
the way French was then learnt:</p>

<p class="noi">At the end is a 'calendar,' or table of words arranged alphabetically
in three parallel columns. The first gives the
orthography of the word, the second the pronunciation, and
the third the explanation of its meaning and construction,
which usually takes the form of an English equivalent.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the grammatical study of French was not
neglected. There are still extant numerous small treatises<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
dealing with different aspects of French grammar, chiefly the
flexions, and belonging to the end of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. The conjugation of verbs receives special
attention, and there are several manuscripts providing
paradigms and lists of the chief parts of speech&mdash;often very
incorrect, and of more value as showing the interest taken in
French in England than as illustrating any development in
the history of the conjugations of French verbs. The usual
verbs described in these fragmentary works<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> are <i>amo</i>, <i>habeo</i>,
<i>sum</i>, <i>volo</i>, <i>facio</i>, and the French paradigms are generally
accompanied by Latin ones, on which they are naturally
based, and which were intended to help the student to understand
the French ("cum expositione earundem in Latinis").
The two most considerable of these works known add many
verbs to the list mentioned above. Of these the first, the
<i>Liber Donati</i>,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> gives examples of law French rather than
literary French;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> but the other, written in French, endeavours
to teach "douce françois de Paris"&mdash;<i>cy comence le Donait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">-31-</a></span>soloum douce franceis de Paris</i>.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The <i>Donait</i> belongs to the
fifteenth century, and is the work of one R. Dove, who also
wrote some <i>Regulae de Orthographia Gallica</i> in Latin,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> which
show considerable resemblance to those of the earlier <i>Orthographia
Gallica</i>. The same is true of some of the rules devoted
to orthography in the <i>Liber Donati</i>, which also owes something
to the work of 'T. H., Student of Paris,' either in the
original form, or, more probably, in the recast, due to Canon
Coyfurelly. In this respect, Coyfurelly continues the efforts
of the earlier writer to purify English spelling of French&mdash;efforts
which at this time would meet with more success
than was the case earlier.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Another topic touched on in the <i>Regulae</i> of R. Dove is
the formation of the plural of nouns, and of the feminine of
adjectives. The substance of one of these rules may be quoted,
as an example of the failure of these early writers to grasp
general principles. All nouns ending in <i>ge</i>, like <i>lange</i>, says
the grammarian, take <i>s</i> in the plural, as <i>langes</i>; all nouns
ending in <i>urc</i>, as <i>bourc</i>, have <i>z</i> or <i>s</i> in the plural and drop the
<i>c</i>, as <i>bours</i>; all nouns ending in <i>nyn</i>, as <i>conyn</i>, take <i>s</i> in the
plural, as <i>chemyns</i>; all nouns ending in <i>eyn</i>, as <i>peyn</i>, form
their plural by adding <i>s</i>, as <i>peyns</i>. Such is the rule for the
formation of the plural of nouns, and that for the feminine
of adjectives, which follows, is on the same lines. Pronouns
also received some attention from these early grammarians.
The <i>Liber Donati</i><a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> contains a few remarks on the personal,
demonstrative and possessive pronouns, giving the different
forms for the singular and plural and the various cases; thus it
tells us that <i>jeo</i> and sometimes <i>moy</i> are used for <i>I</i> (<i>ego</i>) in the
nominative case, and in other cases <i>moy</i> or <i>me</i> in the singular,
while <i>nous</i> is used for the plural in all cases, and so forth.</p>

<p>We thus see that the verbs, nouns and pronouns received
consideration, varying in degree, at the hands of these pioneers
in French grammar. Neither were the indeclinable parts of
speech neglected; at the end of the <i>Liber Donati</i> there is a
list of some of these as well as of the ordinal and cardinal
numbers in both Latin and French, while the <i>Donait</i> gives
the numbers only. Some manuscripts contain lists of adverbs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-32-</a></span>prepositions and conjunctions in Latin and French.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Others
give lists of the cardinal and ordinal numbers in French, and
one adds to these a nomenclature of the different colours.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
The names of the days, months, and feast-days were another
favourite subject.</p>

<p>Of these small treatises that which nearest approaches
the form of a comprehensive grammar is the <i>Liber Donati</i>,
which includes observations on the orthography and pronunciation,
on verbs and pronouns, and lists of adverbs,
conjunctions, and numerals. But there appeared at the
beginning of the fifteenth century, before 1409, a more comprehensive
treatise of some real value&mdash;the <i>Donait françois
pur briefment entroduyr les Anglois en la droit langue du
Paris et de pais la d'entour</i>,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> a work which but for its very
many anglicisms might be placed on a level with some of
the similar grammars of the sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The origin
of this <i>Donait</i> is interesting. A certain Englishman, John
Barton, born and bred in the county of Cheshire, but a student
of Paris, and a passionate lover of the French language,
engaged some good clerks to compose the <i>Donait</i>, at his own
great cost and trouble, for the benefit of the English, who
are so eager ("embrasez") to learn French.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Judging from
the lines with which Barton closes his short but communicative
preface, the work was intended mainly for the use of young
people&mdash;the "chers enfants" and "tres douces pucelles,"
'hungering' to learn French: "Pur ce, mes chiers enfantz et
tresdoulcez puselles," he writes, "que avez fam d'apprendre
cest Donait scachez qu'il est divisé en belcoup de chapiters si
come il apperera cy avale." Barton then retires to make way
for his 'clerks,' whose remarks are entirely confined to grammatical
teaching and who, like Barton, write in French.</p>

<p>Most of the early treatises on French grammar which
appeared in England are written in Latin. Latin appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">-33-</a></span>to have been the medium through which French was learnt
and explained to a large extent, although in the case of the
riming vocabularies English was used for teaching the young
children for whom these nomenclatures were chiefly written.
But grammar, probably intended to be learnt by older students,
was usually studied in Latin, which was also found to be a
help in learning French. Students are told to base French
orthography on that of Latin, and there are constant references
from French words to their Latin originals. The <i>Donait
soloum douce franceis de Paris</i> is apparently the only work
of any importance written in French before that of Barton.
English was not used for this purpose before the sixteenth
century, when it was almost invariably employed, even by
Frenchmen. A grammar such as Barton's would, no doubt,
be read and translated with the help of a tutor; and it is
highly probable that the children for whom it was intended
would have previously acquired some practical knowledge of
French from some such elementary treatise as Bibbesworth's
vocabulary. Moreover, French was so generally in use in
the higher classes of society, and had been for so long a kind
of semi-national tongue, that it would hardly be approached
as an entirely foreign language, as in later times. In writing
a French grammar in French, Barton and those who
followed the same course merely adopted for the teaching
of French a method in common use in the teaching of Latin.
The advisability of writing French grammars in French was
a question, as we shall see, much discussed in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries as well as in much more recent
times.</p>

<p>The clerks employed by Barton made free use of the
observations on French grammar which had appeared previously.
But their work had an additional value; the
rules are stated with considerable clearness and are usually
correct.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The opening chapters deal with the letters and
their pronunciation, set forth, like the rest of the grammar,
in a series of questions and answers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Quantez letters est il? Vint. Quellez? Cinq voielx et quinse consonantez.
Quelx sont les voielx et ou seroit ils sonnés? Le premier
vouyel est <i>a</i> et serra sonné en la poetrine, la seconde est <i>e</i> et serra sonné en
la gorge, le tiers est <i>i</i> et serra sonné entre les joues, le quart est <i>o</i> et serra
sonné du palat de la bouche, le quint est <i>u</i> et serra sonné entre les levres.</p></div>
</div>
<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-34-</a></span>To these observations on the vowels are added a few on the
consonants, and "belcoup de bones rieules" (six in all)
treating the avoidance of hiatus between two consonants and
the effects of certain vowels and consonants on each other's
pronunciation. Next come a few observations on the parts
of speech; for "apres le Chapitre des lettres il nous fault
dire des accidens." Instead of giving a number of isolated
instances as rules for the formation of the plural, the general
rule for the addition of <i>s</i> to the singular is evolved and emphasized
by this advice: "Pour ceo gardez vous que vous ne
mettez pas le singuler pour le pulier (pluriel) ne a contraire,
si come font les sots." Further, we must avoid imitating the
'sottez gens,' to whom frequent reference is made, in using
one person of a tense for another, and saying <i>je ferra</i> for <i>je
ferray</i>.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In this section of the work the rules follow each
other without any orderly arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>At about the same time an English poet is said to have
written a French grammar, as another poet, Alexander
Barclay, actually did later. An early bibliographer<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> includes
in his list of Lydgate's works one entitled <i>Praeceptiones Linguae
Gallicae</i>, in one book, of which no further trace remains
to-day. Lydgate, however, was well acquainted with French;
he made the customary foreign tour, besides visiting Paris
again on a later occasion in attendance on noble patrons, and
put his knowledge of the language to the test by translating
or adapting several works from the French, like most contemporary
writers.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The same early authority informs us
that, as soon as Lydgate returned from his travels, he opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-35-</a></span>a school for the sons of noblemen, possibly at Bury St.
Edmunds. Probably Lydgate wrote a French grammar for
the use of these young noblemen, who would certainly have to
learn the language; and, after serving their immediate purpose,
these rules, we may surmise, were lost and soon forgotten.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century, instruction in French epistolary
style of all degrees continued to be supplied in collections of
model letters; and at the end of the fourteenth century a new
kind of book for teaching French appeared&mdash;the <i>Manière de
Langage</i> or model conversation book, intended for the use
of travellers, merchants, and others desiring a conversational
and practical rather than a thorough and grammatical knowledge
of French. Contrary to the custom, prevalent at this
later period, of providing English translations, the earliest of
these contain no English gloss, but simply the French text
without any attempt at even the slight grammatical instruction
provided in the vocabularies. Their sole purpose was
to give the traveller or wayfarer a supply of phrases and
expressions on the customary topics; grammatical instruction
could be sought elsewhere.</p>

<p>The earliest of these<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> is the first work for teaching
French to which a definite date can be assigned. A sort
of dedication at the end is dated from Bury St. Edmunds,
"la veille du Pentecote, 1396." We have not the same
definite information as to the author.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The anglicisms
make it clear that he was an Englishman, while the
references to Orleans and its university, and the trouble
there between the students and the townspeople in 1389,
suggest that he was a student of that university, then much
frequented by the English and other foreigners, especially
law students. He may have been Canon M. T. Coyfurelly,
Doctor of Law of Orleans,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and author of the contemporary
recasting of T. H.'s treatise on French orthography. The
author tells us he undertook his task at the request of a
"tres honoré et tres gentil sire"; that he had learnt French
"es parties la mere," and that he wrote according to the
knowledge he acquired there, which, he admits, may not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-36-</a></span>perfect. Indeed his French is full of anglicisms; <i>que homme</i>
is written for 'that man'; <i>&#339;uvrer</i> for 'worker'; <i>que</i> for
'why,' and so on; there are also many grammatical mistakes
such as wrong genders, <i>au homme</i>, <i>de les</i> for <i>des</i>, <i>de le</i> for <i>du</i>.
This "manière" must have enjoyed a very considerable
popularity, judging from the number of manuscripts, of
various dates, still in existence. And, in modern times, it
presents a greater interest to the reader than any of the
treatises mentioned before, partly from the naïveté and quaintness
of its style, partly owing to the vivid picture it gives us
of the life of the time at which it was written.</p>

<p>It opens in a religious strain, with a prayer that the students
of the book may have "sens naturel" to learn to speak,
pronounce, and write "doulz françois":</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>A noster commencement nous dirons ainsi: en nom du pere, filz et
Saint Esperit, amen. Ci comence la Maniere de Language qui t'enseignera
bien a droit parler et escrire doulz françois selon l'usage et la coustume
de France. Primiers, au commencement de nostre fait et besogne nous
prierons Dieu devoutement et nostre Dame la benoite vierge Marie sa tres
douce mere, et toute la glorieuse compaigne du Saint reaume de Paradis
celeste, ou Dieux mette ses amis et ses eslus, de quoi vient toute science,
sapience, grace et entendement et tous manieres vertuz, qu'il luy plaist de
sa grande misericorde et grace tous les escoliers estudianz en cest livre
ainsi abruver et enluminer de la rousée de sa haute sapience et entendement,
qu'ils pouront avoir sens naturel d'aprendre a parler, bien soner et a droit
escrire doulz françois.</p></div></div>

<p>Then, because man is the noblest of all created things, the
author proceeds to give a list of the parts of his body, which
recalls the old riming vocabularies. This, however, is the only
portion in which conversation is sacrificed to vocabulary. In
the rest of the work, though the vocabulary is increased by
alternative phrases wherever possible, it is never allowed to
encroach too much on the conversation.</p>

<p>The second chapter presents a scene between a lord and
his page, in which the page receives minute instructions for
commissions to the draper, the mercer, and upholsterer&mdash;an
excellent opportunity of introducing a large choice of words.
Conversation for travellers is the subject of the third chapter,
the most important, and certainly the most interesting in the
whole book. It tells, "Coment un homme chivalchant ou
cheminant se doit contenir et parler sur son chemin qui voult
aler bien loin hors de son pais." After witnessing the preparations
for the journey, the reader accompanies the lord
and his page through an imaginary journey in France.
Dialogue and narrative alternate, and the lord talks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-37-</a></span> with his
page Janyn or whiles away the time with songs:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Et quant il aura achevée sa chanson il comencera a parler a son escuier
ou a ses escuiers, ainsi disant: "Mes amys, il est bien pres de nuyt," vel sic:
"Il sera par temps nuyt." Doncques respont Janyn au son signeur bien
gentilment en cest maniere: "Vrayement mon seigneur, vous ditez verité";
vel sic: "vous ditez voir"; vel sic: "vous dites vray"&mdash;"Je panse bien
qu'il feroit mieux pour nous d'arester en ce ville que d'aller plus avant
maishuy. Coment vous est avis?"&mdash;"Ainsi comme vous vuillez, mon
seigneur." "Janyn!"&mdash;"Mon signeur?"&mdash;"Va devant et prennez
nostre hostel par temps."&mdash;"Si ferai-je, mon seigneur." Et s'en vait
tout droit en sa voie, et quant il sera venu a l'ostel il dira tout <ins title="original: courtoisenent">courtoisement</ins>
en cest maniere. "Hosteler, hosteler," etc.</p></div></div>

<p class="noi">The page then proceeds to make hasty preparations for the
coming of his master to the inn, and we next assist at the
arrival of the lord and his evening meal and diversions&mdash;another
opportunity for the introduction of songs&mdash;and his
departure in the morning towards Étampes and Orleans.</p>

<p>More humble characters appear in the next chapter: "Un
autre manière de parler de pietalle, comme des labourers et
&#339;uvrers de mestiers." Here we have conversations between
members of the working classes. A gardener and a ditcher
discuss their respective earnings, describe their work, and
finally go and dine together; a baker talks with his servant,
and so gives us the names of the chief things used in his trade,
just as the gardener gave a list of flowers and fruits. A
merchant scolds his apprentice for various misdemeanours,
and then sends him off to market:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Doncques l'apprentiz s'en vait au marchié pour vendre les danrées de
son maistre et la vienment grant cop des gens de divers pais de les achater:
et apprentiz leur dit tout courtoisement en cest maniere,&mdash;'Mes amis venez
vous ciens et je vous monstrerai de aussi bon drap comme vous trouverez
en tout ce ville, et vous en aurez de aussi bon marché comme nul autre.
Ore regardez, biau sire, comment vous est avis; vel sic: comment vous
plaist il;</p></div></div>

<p class="noi">and after some bargaining he sells his goods.</p>

<p>In the next "manière de parler" a servant brings a torn
doublet to a mender of old clothes, and enlists his services.
A chapter of more interest and importance is that dealing
with greetings and salutations to be used at different times of
the day to members of the various ranks of society:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Quant un homme encontrera aucun au matinée il luy dira tout courtoisement
ainsi: "Mon signour Dieux vous donne boun matin et bonne aventure,"
vel sic: "Sire Dieux vous doint boun matin et bonne estraine, Mon
amy, Dieux vous doint bon jour et bonne encontre." Et a midi vous parlerez
en cest maniere: "Monsieur Dieux vous donne bon jour et bonnes heures";
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-38-</a></span>vel sic: "Sire, Dieu vous beneit et la compaignie!" A peitaille vous direz
ainsi: "Dieux vous gart!" . . . Et as &#339;uvrers et labourers vous direz
ainsi: "Dieux vous ait, mon amy,"</p></div></div>

<p class="noi">and so on. One traveller asks another whence he comes and
where he was born, and the other says he comes from Orleans,
where there is a fierce quarrel between the students and the
townspeople; and was born in Hainaut, where they love the
English well, and there is a saying that "qui tient un Henner
(Hennuyer) par la main, tient un Englois par le cuer." We are
next taught how to speak to children: "Quant vous verez un
enfant plorer et gemir, vous direz ainsi: Qu'as tu, mon enfant,"
and comfort him, and when a poor man asks you for alms,
you shall answer, "Mon amy, se je pourroi je vous aidasse
tres volantiers. . . ."</p>

<p>From this we return to subjects more suited to merchants
and wayfarers&mdash;how to inquire the road, and to go on a
pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Thomas-à-Becket. The work
closes with a gathering of companions in an inn, which, like
the rest of the chapters, is full of life and interest. Last of
all, a sort of supplement is added in the form of a short poem
on the drawbacks of poverty:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Il est hony qui pouveres est,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">and a <i>fatrasie</i> in prose.</p>

<p>Another treatise of the same kind, written about three
years later, was intended chiefly for the use of children, <i>Un
petit livre pour enseigner les enfantz de leur entreparler comun
françois</i>.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> It was not the first of its kind. The metrical
vocabularies of Bibbesworth and his successors were chiefly
intended for the use of children. There is also some evidence
to show that the grammatical treatises were used by children;
the commentary was added to the <i>Orthographica Gallica</i>
because the rules were somewhat obscure "pour jeosne
gentz," and Barton, in his introduction, mentions the "chiers
enfantz" and "tresdoulez puselles," as those whom his
grammar particularly concerns.</p>

<p>In the <i>Petit livre</i>, however, the teaching is of the
simplest kind, and specially suited to children. The dialogue
lacks the interest of the earlier 'manière,' and inclines, in
places, to become a list of phrases pure and simple. The
work opens abruptly with the words: "Pour ce sachez
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">-39-</a></span>premierement que le an est divisé en deux, c'est asscavoir
le yver et la esté. Le yver a six mois et la esté atant, que
vallent douse," and so on to the other divisions of the
year and time. The children are then taught the numbers
in French, the names of the coins, and those of the
persons and things with which they come into daily contact.
Then follow appropriate terms for addressing and greeting
different persons, and the author even goes so far as to provide
the child with a stock of insulting terms for use in quarrels.
The rest of the treatise does not appear to be intended for
children. There are conversations in a tavern, lists of salutations,
familiar talk for the wayside and for buying and selling,
all of which has little special interest, and is designed apparently
to meet the needs of merchants more than any other
class. In the chatter on the events of the day there occurs a
passage which enables us to date the work. The traveller tells
the hostess of the captivity of Richard II. as a recent event:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>"Dieu, dame, j'ay ouy dire que le roy d'<ins title="original: Angliterre">Angleterre</ins> est osté."&mdash;"Quoy
desioie!"&mdash;"Par ma alme voir."&mdash;"Et les Anglois n'ont ils point de roy
donques?"&mdash;"Marie, ouy, et que celuy que fust duc de Lancastre, que est
nepveu a celluy que est osté."&mdash;"Voire?"&mdash;"Voire vraiement."&mdash;"Et le
roygne que fera elle?"&mdash;"Par dieu dame, je ne sçay, je n'ay pas esté en
conceille."&mdash;"Et le roy d'Angleterre ou fust il coronné?"&mdash;"A Westmynstre."&mdash;"Fustez
vous la donques?"&mdash;"<ins title="original: Maris">Marie</ins>, oy, il y avoit tant de
presse que par un pou que ne mouru quar a paine je eschapey a vie."&mdash;"Et
ou serra il a nouvel?"&mdash;"Par ma foy je ne sçay, mais l'en dit qu'il serra en
Escoce."</p></div></div>

<p>The authorship is not so easy to ascertain. The manual
may be due to Canon T. Coyfurelly, probable author of the
earlier and better-known work also.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The many mistakes
and anglicisms, such as <i>quoy</i> for <i>quelle</i> ('what') and the
exclamatory 'Marie' in the quotation just given, show it to
be the work of an Englishman.</p>

<p>Another book of conversation appeared in 1415,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> as may
be gathered from its first two chapters, in which a person
fresh from the wars in France tells of the siege of Harfleur
and the battle of Agincourt, and announces the return of the
victorious English army. The rest of the dialogues are
represented as taking place in and about Oxford. There is
the usual tavern scene. Travellers from Tetsworth arrive at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-40-</a></span>an Oxford inn, and are present at the evening meal and diversions.
The hostess describes the fair at Woodstock and the
articles bought and sold there; her son, a boy of twelve years,
wants to be apprenticed in London; he goes to the school of
Will Kyngesmylle, where writing, counting, and French are
taught. One of the merchants calls the lad and questions
him as to his knowledge of French: "Et que savez vous en
fraunceys dire?&mdash;Sir je say moun noun et moun corps bien
descrire.&mdash;Ditez moy qu'avez a noun.&mdash;J'ay a noun Johan,
bon enfant, beal et sage et bien parlant engleys, fraunceys et
bon normand, beneyt soit la verge que chastie l'enfant et le
bon maistre qui me prist taunt! Je pri a Dieu tout puissant
nous graunte le joye tous diz durant!" The lad then proceeds
to give proof of his knowledge by naming the parts of his
body and his clothing, always, it appears, the first things
learnt.</p>

<p>This reference to the teaching of French in the school of
an Oxford pedagogue shows that, though French had at this
time lost all standing in the Grammar Schools, it was still
taught in private establishments.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> It seems highly probable
that Will Kyngesmylle was the author of this work, and that
he used his text-book as a means of self-advertisement, a
method very common among later teachers of French. At
the close comes a chapter belonging to another work of the
same type, which is only preserved in this fragment; no
doubt other such works existed and have been entirely lost.</p>

<p>It is likely that in the fifteenth century these conversational
manuals supplanted, to a considerable extent, the earlier type
of practical manual for teaching French&mdash;the metrical vocabulary&mdash;with
which they had something in common. At any
rate, there is no copy of such nomenclatures extant after
<i>Femina</i> (1415). The 'manières' provided in their dialogues
much of the material found in the vocabularies, giving,
wherever possible, groups of words on the same topics&mdash;the
body, its clothing, houses, and men's occupations.
Further, the vocabularies, which had never departed from
the type instituted by Bibbesworth in the thirteenth century,
dealt more with the feudal and agricultural life of the Middle
Ages, and so had fallen behind the times. The 'Manières
de Langage' were more in keeping with the new conditions.
Towards the end of the century (and perhaps at the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">-41-</a></span>of the sixteenth century) we come to a manual,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> which, while
resembling the 'manières' in most points, reproduces some
of the distinctive external marks of the vocabularies. For
instance, the French is arranged in short lines, which, however,
do not rime, and vary considerably in the number of
syllables they contain; and these are followed by a full
interlinear English gloss, as in the later vocabularies. The
subject matter, however, is similar to that of the early conversation
books. First comes gossip at taverns and by the
wayside:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">
<div><div lang="fr">Ditez puisse ie savement aler?</div><div>
Saie may I saufly goo?</div></div>
<div><div lang="fr">Ye sir le chemyn est sure assez.</div><div>
Yes sir the wey is sure inough.</div></div>
<div><div lang="fr">Mes il convent que vous hastez.</div><div>
But it behoveth to spede you.</div></div>
<div><div lang="fr">Sir dieu vous donne bon aventure.</div><div>

<div><div lang="fr">Sir a dieu vous commaunde.</div><div>

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="interlinear">
<div><div lang="fr">Sir dieu vous esploide.</div><div>

<div><div lang="fr">Sir bon aventure avez vous.</div><div>

<div><div lang="fr">Sir par saint Marie cy est bon servise.</div><div>

<div><div lang="fr">Sir pernes le hanappe, vous comenceres.</div><div>

Dame I wil not doo bifor you.</div></div>
<div><div lang="fr">Sir vous ferrez verrement.</div><div>
Sir ye shal sothely.</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p class="noi">After some disconnected discourse on inquiring the time,
asking the way, etc., we again return to the tavern:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">
<div><div lang="fr">Dame dieu vous donne bon jour.</div><div>
Dame god geve you good daie.</div></div>
<div><div lang="fr">Dame avez hostel pour nous trois compaignons?</div>
<div>Dame have ye hostel for us iij felowes?</div></div>
<div><div lang="fr">Sir quant longement voudrez demourer?</div><div>

<div><div lang="fr">Sir non meynns que vj deniers le iour.</div><div>
Sir noo lesse thenne vj d. the day ... etc.
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-42-</a></span>Next comes the usual scene between buyers and sellers,
followed by another inn scene of greater length. After
attending to their horses, the travellers sup and spend the
night at the inn, and set out the next morning after reckoning
with their hostess. The manuscript ends abruptly in the
midst of a list of salutations. The nature of the French<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
betrays the author's nationality; he was evidently an Englishman.
As to the English, the quaint turn given to many of
the phrases is usually explained by the writer's desire to give
a literal translation of the French; many of the inaccuracies
in both versions are probably due to careless work on the
part of the scribe.</p>

<p>Merchants thus appear to have been one of the chief classes
among which there was a demand for instruction in French.
In addition to the large part assigned to them in the 'Manières
de Langage,' and in the epistolaries, where letters of a commercial
nature are a usual feature, there exist collections of
model forms for drawing up bills, indentures, receipts and
other documents of similar import. They are usually called
'cartularies,' are accompanied by explanations in Latin, and
may be looked upon as the first text-books of commercial
French.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> One author explains their origin and aim by this
introductory remark:<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> "Pour ceo qe j'estoie requis par

acquitancez, contuaries, salutaries, en Latin et Franceys
ensemblement . . . fesant les chartours, escripts munimentz
a de primes en Latyn et puis en Franceys."</p>

<p>More emphasis is laid on the demand for instruction in
French among the merchant class by the fact that the earliest
printed text-books were designed chiefly for their use. The
first of these may be classed with the new development of
the 'Manières de Langage,' comprising dialogues in French
and English, although it does not exactly answer to this
description.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It was issued from the press of William Caxton
in about 1483, and at least one other edition appeared at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">-43-</a></span>later date.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In form it is a sort of narrative in French, with
an English translation opposite. The aim of the work is
stated clearly in an introductory passage which informs the
reader that "who this book shall learn may well enterprise
merchandise from one land to another and to know many wares
which to him shall be good to be bought, or sold for rich to
become." Caxton thus recommends the book to the learner:</p>

<p>The 'doctrine' itself opens with a list of salutations with the

next, then its inhabitants, which introduces the subject of
degrees of kinship:</p>

<p class="noi">At the end of the category come the servants and their
occupations, which affords an opportunity of bringing in the
different shops to which they are sent and of specifying the
meat and drink they purchase there. We then pass to buying,
selling, and bargaining in general, and to merchandise of all
kinds, with a list of coins, popular fairs, and fête-days.</p>

<p>After an enumeration of the great persons of the earth
comes the main chapter of the work, giving a fairly complete
list of crafts and trades. This takes the form of
an alphabetical list of Christian names, each of which is
made to represent one of the trades, beginning with Adam
the ostler: "For this that many words shall fall or may fall
which be not plainly heretofore written, so shall I write you
from henceforth divers matters of all things, first of one
thing, then of another, in which chapter I will conclude the
names of men and women after the order of a, b, c." The
baker may be selected as a fair example:</p>

<div class="table">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" summary="baker as example">

<td>So that he hath not</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="fr">Du chier marchiet.</span></td>
<td>Of the dere chepe (high buying prices).</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noi">At last the author, "all weary of so many names to name,
of so many crafts, so many offices, so many services," finds
relief in certain considerations of a religious order: "God
hath made us unto the likeness of himself, he will reward
those who do well and punish those who do not repent of
their sins, and attend the holy services: If ye owe any
pilgrimages, so pay them hastily; when you be moved for to
go your journey, and ye know not the waye, so axe it thus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">-45-</a></span>"
The usual directions for inquiring the way follow with the
description of the arrival at an inn, and the customary gossip.
The reckoning and departure on the following morning afford
an opportunity of including a further list of Flemish and
English coins together with the numerals; and Caxton concludes
his work by commending it to the reader with a prayer
that those who study it may persevere sufficiently to profit
by it:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The short introduction and epilogue were most probably
the composition of Caxton himself. The rest of the book is
drawn from a set of dialogues in French and Flemish, first
written at the beginning of the fourteenth century, called
<i>Le Livre des Mestiers</i> in reference to its main chapter.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> This
would possibly be known to merchants trading with Bruges
and other centres of the Low Countries; and when we notice
the numerous points of resemblance between it and the
English manuals of conversation, the first of which did not
appear before the end of the same century, it seems very
probable that the Flemish original had some influence on
the works produced in England. Caxton was a silk mercer
of London, and his business took him to the towns of the Low
Countries, especially Bruges, where the English merchants
had a large commercial connexion. There, no doubt, he
became acquainted with the <i>Livre des Mestiers</i>, and probably
improved his knowledge of French by its help, for he studied
and read the language a good deal during his long sojourn
abroad. There also he probably added an English column
to his copy of the French-Flemish phrase-book, as a sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">-46-</a></span>exercise rather than with any serious intention of publication;
and when he had set up his press at Westminster, remembering
the need he had felt for French, in his own commercial experience,
and the little book which had assisted him, he would
decide to print it. Caxton's copy of the <i>Livre des Mestiers</i>
belonged, no doubt, to a later date than the one extant
to-day,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> probably to the beginning of the fifteenth century.
It must have been fuller, and have had different names
attached to the characters, so that, as the names are still
arranged in alphabetical order, it is difficult, at a glance, to
distinguish the identity of the two texts.</p>

<p>Caxton's rendering of the French is often inaccurate,
owing perhaps to the influence of the Flemish version from
which he seems to have made his translation.<a name="FNanchor_117b_117b" id="FNanchor_117b_117b"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Moreover, at
the early date at which Caxton, probably, added the English
column to the <i>Livre des Mestiers</i>, his knowledge of French
had not yet reached that state of thoroughness which was to
enable him to translate such a remarkable number of French
works into English. He himself tells us in the prologue
to the <i>Recuyell of the Histories of Troy</i> of Raoul le Fèvre
(Bruges, 1475)&mdash;the first of his translations from the French,
and, indeed, the first book to be printed in English&mdash;that his
knowledge of French was not by any means perfect. With
the exception of the introductory and closing sentences,
Caxton made few additions to his original. He did indeed
supply the names of English towns, coins, bishoprics, and so
on; but, on the whole, the setting of the work is foreign;
Bruges, not London, is the centre of the action, and no
doubt the place where the original was composed.</p>

<p>Not long after the publication of Caxton's doctrine another
work of like character and purpose appeared. It claims to
be "a good book to learn to speak French for those who wish
to do merchandise in France, and elsewhere in other lands
where the folk speak French." The atmosphere is entirely
English, and consequently its contents bear a closer resemblance
to its English predecessors. In the arrangement of
the dialogue it is identical with the Cambridge conversation
book, except that the English lines come before the French,
and not the French before the English.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The four subjects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-47-</a></span>round which the dialogue turns, namely, salutations, buying
and selling, inquiring the way, and conversation at the inn,
were all favourites in the early "Manières de Langage."
For the rest it follows in the steps of its English predecessors
in confining itself to dialogue pure and simple, while Caxton's
'doctrine' adopted the narrative form. In one point, however,
the work differs from the latest development of the
old "Manière de Langage," as preserved in the Cambridge
Dialogues in French and English; the dialogues are followed
by a vocabulary, then a reprint of one of the old books on
courtesy and demeanour for children, with a French version
added, and finally commercial letters in French and English.
The work is thus made much more comprehensive than any
of its type which had as yet appeared, and includes samples,
so to speak, of all the practical treatises for teaching French
which had appeared in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>It was printed separately by the two chief printers of the
time, both foreigners: Richard Pynson, a native of Normandy
and student of Paris, who came to England and began printing
on his own account about 1590-1591; and Wynkyn de
Worde, a native of Alsace, and apprentice to Caxton, with
whom he probably came to England from Bruges in 1476, and
to whose business he succeeded in 1491.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Although neither
of the printers dated their work, it seems probable that the
earliest edition was issued by Pynson. There is a unique
copy of his edition in the British Museum; it is without
title-page, pagination, or catch-words, and the colophon reads
simply "Per me Ricardum Pynson." The colophon of
Wynkyn's work, of which there is a complete copy in the
Grenville Library (British Museum),<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and a fragment of two
leaves in the Bodleian, is slightly more instructive and runs
as follows: "Here endeth a lytyll treatyse for to lern Englyshe
and Frensshe. Emprynted at Westmynster by my Wynken
de Worde." Now as Wynkyn moved from Westminster in
1500 to set up his shop in the centre of the trade in Fleet
Street, opposite to that of his rival Pynson, his edition of the
work must have appeared before that date, because it was
issued from what had been Caxton's house in Westminster.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">-48-</a></span>On the other hand, the type used by Pynson is archaic,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and
the work is evidently one of the earliest issued from his press.
It is inferior to Wynkyn's edition from the technical point of
view. A headline is all there is by way of title; while in
Wynkyn's copy we find a separate title-page, containing the
words, "Here begynneth a lytell treatyse for to lern Englishe
and Frensshe," and a woodcut of a schoolmaster seated in a
large chair, with a large birch-rod in his left hand, and, on a
stool at his feet, three small boys holding open books. This
particular woodcut was a favourite in school-books of the
period;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> it appears, for instance, in a little treatise entitled
<i>Pervula</i>, giving instructions for turning English into Latin,
which Wynkyn de Worde printed about 1495.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Moreover,
each page of Wynkyn's edition has a descriptive headline,
"Englysshe and Frensshe," which is not found in Pynson's.
The text also is in many places more accurate than that
of the Norman printer, and gives the impression of having
been corrected here and there. It is therefore probable that
Pynson first printed the treatise shortly after 1490,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and
that another edition was issued by Wynkyn de Worde
during the period intervening between the date of the issue
of Pynson's edition and the end of the century. A remnant,
consisting of one page of yet another edition, is preserved in
the British Museum, and shows some variations in spelling
from the two other texts.</p>

<p>This little book, then, seems to have enjoyed considerable
popularity during its short life. On the whole it is more
elementary in character than the 'doctrine' of Caxton. The
first things taught are the numbers and a list of ordinary
mercantile phrases. The opening passage is very much like
that written by Caxton for his work:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">

<div><div>And fyrst I wylle lerne to reken by lettre.</div>
<div lang="fr">Et premierement je veux aprendre a compter par lettre. . . .

<p>Next come the cardinal numbers and a vocabulary of
words "goode for suche as use marchaundyse":</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">
<div><div>

<div lang="fr">D'or et d'argent.</div></div>

<div lang="fr">De velours et damas etc. . . .
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="noi">and so on for nearly a page, in which the names of various
cloths, spices, and wines are provided.</p>

<p>Then follows another "manner of speeche" in a list of
salutations arranged in dialogue form:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">

<div lang="fr">Autre magniere de langage en françoys.</div></div>

<blockquote class="interlinear">

<div lang="fr">Sire, Dieu soit avecques vous.</div></div></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-50-</a></span>Yet another favourite subject is next introduced&mdash;a conversation
on buying and selling:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">

<div lang="fr">Aultre magniere de langage pour vendre et achatter.</div></div>

<div><div>Ye shall have it for no lasse.</div>
<div lang="fr">Vous ne l'avrez pour riens mains.</div></div></blockquote>

<p>The merchant has also to be able to ask for directions on his
way, and to gossip with the landlady of the wayside inn;
the phrases necessary for these purposes are recorded in the
next "manner of speech," where, as in the first treatise of
1396, the scene is laid in France:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">

<p>Here the 'manière de langage' ends. It is followed by
a list of nouns arranged under headings. The enumeration
begins with the parts of the body,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> followed by the clothing
and armour&mdash;a list containing valuable information on the
fashions of the time; then come the natural phenomena,
the sun, the stars, water, the winds, and so on; the products
of the earth and the food they supply, and finally, the names
of the days of the week. With the exception of the last
page, each word is preceded by a possessive adjective or an
article indicating its gender. The English rendering is sometimes
placed above the French word, sometimes opposite.</p>

<p>After the vocabulary, which covers nearly five pages,
comes the courtesy book in English and French, occupying
the next seven pages. It is a reprint of the <i>Lytylle Chyldrenes
Lytil Boke</i>,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> which contains a set of maxims for discreet
behaviour at meals, in which children are told not to snatch
meat from the table before grace is said; not to throw bones
on the floor; nor pick their teeth with their knife; nor do
many other things, which, when we remember that such books
were intended for the instruction of the gentry, throw interesting
sidelights on contemporary manners. The inclusion of
such precepts for children in a text-book for teaching French
was not without precedent; in the last of the series of riming
vocabularies, <i>Femina</i> (1415), there is a collection of moral
maxims taken, in this instance, from the ancient writers,
and printed in Latin, French, and English.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the author reverts to the more strictly
commercial side of the treatise, with two letters, given in both
French and English. One is from an apprentice who writes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">-53-</a></span>to his master reporting on some business he is transacting at
Paris, and asking for more money. In the second a merchant
communicates to his 'gossip' the news of the arrival at
London and Southampton of ships laden with rich merchandise,
and proposes that they should "find means and ways
in this that their shops shall be well stuffed of all manner of
merchandise." In both these letters the English comes first:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A prentyse wryteth to his mayster, fyrste in Englysshe and after in

<p>And so ends this interesting little book.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The texts of the
two complete editions are in the main identical. The arrangement
of the matter on the pages is different, and the spelling
of the words, both French and English, varies considerably.
Slips which occur in Pynson's text, such as the rendering of
'neuf' by 'ten,' or the accidental omission of a word in the
French version, are sometimes corrected in Wynkyn's version.
On the other hand, similar mistakes, though much fewer in
number, are found in Wynkyn's edition and not in Pynson's;
while yet others are common to both the printers. Dialect
forms are scattered through the two editions with equal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">-54-</a></span>capriciousness. Both texts contain a few anglo-normanisms.
Pynson's shows numerous characteristics of the North-Eastern
dialects, Picard or Lorrain, but at times there is a
Picard form in Wynkyn's version, where the pure French form
occurs in the other. Apart from such variations, the wording
of the two editions is usually similar. In cases where it differs,
the improvements are found in Wynkyn's edition, in spite
of the fact that, as a general rule, the output of Pynson's
press reaches a higher literary level than that of the more
business-like Alsatian. This exception may, no doubt, be
explained by the fact that Pynson was the first to print
the <i>Good Book to learn to speak French</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Yet here again
mistakes are sometimes common to both texts, as, for instance,
the rendering of the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the clerks that the seven arts can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sythen that courtesy from heaven came,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">by the French:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pour les clers qui les sept arts savent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puisque courtoisie de paradis vint,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">in which the wrong interpretation of the English 'for' (conjunction)
and 'sythen' (taken as meaning 'since,' not 'say')
destroys the sense.</p>

<p>On the whole, the impression conveyed by the perusal of
the two editions is that the work is a compilation of treatises
already in existence in manuscript. Neither the letters nor
the vocabulary present any strikingly new features. The
origin of the courtesy book is known, and it is even possible
that the fragment of one leaf preserved belongs, not to another
edition of the <i>Good Book to learn to speak French</i>, but to an
earlier edition of the courtesy book in French and English,
printed probably by Caxton, with the intention of imparting a
knowledge of polite behaviour and of the favourite language
of polite society at the same time. The fact that it reproduces
the original courtesy book more fully than does either of the
complete texts of Wynkyn and Pynson, suggests that it
belonged to some such edition, or to an edition of the <i>Good
Book</i> earlier than either of these. As to the dialogues, they
may have belonged to the group of conversational manuals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">-55-</a></span>which were, no doubt, fairly numerous. Caxton, while maintaining
that his 'doctrine' contains more than "many other
books," adds: "That which cannot be found declared
in it, shall be found elsewhere in other books." That such
practical little books shared the fate of the great majority of
school manuals is not surprising.</p>

<p>The hypothesis that the work is a compilation of older
treatises would, moreover, explain the variations in the
quality of the French. The dialogues and letters, it would
appear, were in the first place written by Englishmen. Pynson
corrected them here and there, without, however, eliminating
all the anglicisms, archaisms, and provincial forms; and when
they passed through the hands of Wynkyn they underwent
still further emendation. The English version contains
gallicisms, just as the French contains anglicisms,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> which
were, however, probably due to a desire to make the English
tally with the French. This same supposition also makes it
easier to understand how it came about that the treatise
was printed by the two rival printers within the space of a
few years, and explains how it was they repeated the same
obvious mistakes.</p>

<p>Thus, of the matter found in the mediaeval treatises
for teaching French, grammar rules alone are unrepresented
in this <i>Good Book</i>. Its aim is entirely practical. It
seeks to teach those who wish to "lerne to <i>speke</i> Frensshe"
for practical purposes, that is, "to do their merchaundise,"
and there is no mention of any deeper or wider knowledge of
the language. That the work was intended for the use of
children as well as for merchants is shown by the introduction
of the courtesy book, and, in the later edition, of the favourite
frontispiece for children's school-books described above. But
these do not form a vital part of the work itself, and are mere
supplements, added probably with the intention of increasing
the public to which the book would appeal. The children
who used it, we may assume, would probably be of the class
of the boy, "John, enfant beal et sage," who appears in the
'manière' of 1415, and learns French that he may the more
quickly achieve his end of being apprenticed to a London
merchant. To such children the apprentice's letter quoted
above would be of much interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">-56-</a></span>Grammar did not hold a very large place in the teaching
of French at this time. Practice and conversation were the
usual methods of acquiring a knowledge of spoken French,
and no doubt such books as those of Caxton and of Pynson
and Wynkyn de Worde found many eager students. The two
editions of the first and the three editions of the second with
which we are acquainted, all of which probably appeared in
the course of the last decade of the fifteenth century, bear
testimony to this. Reference has already been made to the
probable existence of numerous works of a similar scope in
manuscript, and later in print. Such were the "little pages,
set in print, with no precepts," to which Claude Holyband,
the most popular French teacher of London in the second
half of the sixteenth century, refers with contempt; he
accuses them of wandering from the 'true phrase' of the
language, and of teaching nothing of the reading and pronunciation,
"which is the chiefest point to be considered in
that behalf," and hence of serving but little to the "furtherance
of the knowledge of the French tongue." Yet, though such
was the case in all these early works, they seem, without
exception, to have enjoyed great popularity at the time they
were written, when to speak French fluently was an all-important
matter. The difficulty of this accomplishment
was realised to the full. We find it expressed in a few disconnected
sentences added in French probably at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, at the end of the 'manière de
langage' of 1396: "We need very long practice before we
are able to speak French perfectly," says the anonymous
writer, evidently an Englishman, "for the French and English
do not correspond word for word, and the fine distinctions
are difficult to seize." He proceeds to urge the necessity of a
glib tongue in making progress in French, and quotes the case
of an unfortunate man, good fellow though he might otherwise
be, who lacked this faculty: "Il ne luy avient plus a
parler franceis qu'à une vache de porter une selle, a cause que
sa langue n'est pas bien afilée, et pour cela n'entremette il pas
à parler entre les fraunceis."</p>

<p>In the early part of the sixteenth century, however, French
began to be studied with more thoroughness in England.
Communication with France and the tour in France were
no longer fraught with the same dangers and difficulties,
and favoured the use of a purer form of French. Fluent
was no longer sufficient without correct pronunciation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">-57-</a></span>and grammar. The standard of French taught was also raised
by the arrival of numerous Frenchmen, who made the teaching
of their language the business of their lives. Further, the
spread of the art of printing had rendered French literature
more accessible, and supplied a rich material from which the
rules of the language might be deduced. And so it became
possible for John Palsgrave, the London teacher and student
of Paris, to complete the first great work on the French
language, in which, however, he did not forget to render due
homage to his humble predecessors,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> then fast passing into
oblivion.</p>

of Latin, which is naturally the basis of the terminology of this work and all others
for many years after; then come observations on the degrees of comparison, after
which we return to the verbs, and their moods and tenses. The following sections
deal with the parts of speech; the four indeclinables (adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions,
and interjections) are merely mentioned. Nouns, adjectives, and pronouns
receive some attention, but the chief subject is the verb: "Cy maintenant nous vous

few of the best known are conjugated as examples. In the list of impersonal verbs
which closes the treatise, English is sometimes used to explain their meaning: "Me
est avis, <i>Me seemth</i>."</p></div>

<h3>THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AT COURT AND AMONG THE NOBILITY</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of the sixteenth century the gradual changes
which brought about the extinction of Anglo-French were
complete to all intents and purposes; this corrupt form of the
language lingered only in a few religious houses and the law
courts. The French spoken at the English Court in the
Middle Ages had remained purer than elsewhere; for centuries
the kings of England were as much attached to France as to
England; they had spent much of their time in France and
fought for the French crown as their natural right, not as
Englishmen in strife with Frenchmen. From the thirteenth
century, however, English was understood, though not
widely spoken, at Court. It progressed gradually until, two
centuries later, in the reign of Henry VI., it was used more
frequently than French. By the sixteenth century French
was an entirely foreign language at the English Court, and
it was round the Court circles that developed the new and
more serious study of the language which then arose&mdash;a
study which led to the production of so important a
work as John Palsgrave's <i>L'Esclarcissement de la langue
françoyse</i>. It will therefore be well to consider the extent
to which French was used among the nobility and gentry of
the time.</p>

<p>The personal ascendancy of the Tudors and the pomp of
their Court began to attract the attention of foreigners, and
to excite their curiosity. Consequently numerous travellers
made their way to the English capital; and later in the same
period religious persecution, raging on the Continent, drove
many Protestants, frequently men of distinction, to seek
refuge in England. What language would these visitors
employ in their intercourse with their hosts? English is
excluded from the purview, because at this time, and indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">-62-</a></span>for some time after, our language received no recognition, and
certainly no homage from any foreigner, and but scant deference
from English scholars themselves.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Several foreign visitors
in London have left an account of their impressions on hearing
this entirely unknown and strange language spoken. Thus
Nicander Nucius, the Greek Envoy at the Court of Henry
VIII., says of the English that "they possess a peculiar
language, differing in some measure from all others"; although
it is "barbarous," he finds in it a certain charm and attraction,
and judges it "sweeter" than German or Flemish.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Others
formed a less favourable opinion.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The physician Girolamo
Cordano, for instance, when he first heard Englishmen speaking,
thought they were Italians gone mad and raving, "for
they inflect the tongue upon the palate, twist words in the
mouth, and maintain a sort of gnashing with the teeth." The
Dutchman, Immanuel von Meteren, gathered the impression
that English is broken German, "not spoken from the heart
as the latter, but only prattling with the tongue."</p>

<p>We have, however, to recollect that, among the learned,
Latin was in general use as a spoken language; it was the
ideal of the Humanists to make Latin the universal language
of the educated world. Erasmus was able to live several
years in England, and in familiar intercourse with Englishmen,
without feeling the necessity for learning English or
using any other modern language; but he mingled almost
entirely with scholars, such as Grocyn, Linacre, Latimer,
Colet, and More&mdash;men with whom Henry VIII. loved to
surround himself. Still, the great Dutchman was an exception
even amongst Humanists, who nearly all, at some period in
their lives, forsook Latin for their native tongue. Moreover,
Latin was not fluently or colloquially spoken by the majority
of the English nobility and gentry. The poet, Alexander
Barclay, tells us that "the understandyne of Latyn," in the
early years of the sixteenth century, was "almost contemned
by Gentylmen."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> "I have not these twenty years used any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">-63-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">THE SPEAKING OF LATIN</span>Latin tongue,"<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> said Latimer at his trial for heresy in 1554&mdash;a
striking testimony on the lips of one whose natural
sympathies were towards Humanism. Some years later the
great Huguenot scholar, Hubert Languet, wrote to his young
English friend, Sir Philip Sidney&mdash;then newly returned from
continental travel&mdash;to express his apprehension lest the young
man should forget all his Latin at the English Court and
entirely give up the practice of it; he urges him to do his best
to prevent this, and maintain his Latin along with his French.
Languet affirms that he has never heard Sidney pronounce
a syllable of French incorrectly, and wishes his pronunciation
of Latin were as perfect.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Sidney, however, does not appear
to have considered Latin of as much importance to a courtier
as French: "So you can speake and write Latine not barbarously,"
he wrote to his brother Robert in 1580,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> "I never
require great study ordinarily in Ciceronianisme, the cheife
abuse of Oxford." No doubt Sidney voices a general sentiment
in this verdict. It is increasingly clear that the
supremacy of Latin was beginning to be questioned on all
sides, and, while Latin remained to a large extent the language
of scholars, it was not generally employed in society.</p>

<p>Further, when the English did speak Latin, foreigners
had considerable difficulty in understanding them, on account
of their notoriously bad pronunciation. The great scholar
Scaliger, who was in England in 1590, tells that he once listened
to an Englishman talking Latin for a quarter of an hour, and
at last excused himself, saying that he did not understand
English!<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> To the same effect is the observation of Tom
Coryat, the traveller, who, on his journey on the Continent,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
found his Latin so little understood, that he had to modify
his pronunciation. At a later date, when the Grand Duke
of Tuscany, Cosmo III., visited the two English Universities,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
he was unable to understand the Latin speeches and
orations with which he was greeted. A Latin comedy which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">-64-</a></span>the Cambridge students performed in his honour was
equally unintelligible to him. "To smatter Latin with an
English mouth," wrote Milton in a well-known passage, "is
as ill a hearing as Law French."</p>

<p>At the same time a quickened interest in modern
languages generally was felt in England as in other countries.
Two of these, Italian and Spanish, entered the arena to
challenge the supremacy of French in the world of fashion
and intellect. The real issue of the contest, however, was
never in doubt. The Renaissance and the new Humanism
appeared for a time to favour the Italian rival,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> but the
inherent merits of French, with its particular genius for
precision and clarity, easily won the day. Those circles&mdash;often
very brilliant circles&mdash;of distinguished men and women
for whom the Renaissance was as the dawn of a new day,
often made Italian a more serious object of study than French;
but though it was widely learned for the sake of its literature,
it was never so widely spoken or so universally popular
as French. Italian, and to a minor degree Spanish, were
indeed seriously cultivated by the Tudor group of distinguished
linguists,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and so became a sort of fashion, which,
spreading to more frivolous circles, soon degenerated into
mere affectation. These dilettanti had been at a great feast
of languages and stolen the scraps, to use Shakespeare's
words. Such affectation was naturally felt to be dangerous.
While Roger Ascham renders due homage to the linguistic
attainments of his queen,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> he finds it necessary to reproach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">-65-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">INTEREST IN MODERN LANGUAGES</span>the young gentlemen of the day with their deficiency in this
respect. Professional teachers of modern languages likewise
complain of the lack of seriousness on the part of many of
their pupils. John Florio,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> for example, bewails the fact that
when they have learned two words of Spanish, three words
of French, and four words of Italian, they think they have
enough, and will study no more; and a French teacher<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> expresses
the same thought in almost identical terms; according to
him they learn a little French one day, then a bit of Italian
and a snatch of Spanish, and think themselves qualified for
an embassy to the Grand Turk. Shakespeare's Falconbridge,
the young baron of England, may be taken as a fair example
of such dilettantism.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Thus Italian was never a really dangerous rival to French,
which had struck its roots deep into the English soil long
before Italian influence reached our shores. Not only was
this the case, but French was also widely known throughout
Europe. Even in the early years of this period, the poet
Alexander Barclay, himself the author of a French grammar,
affirms that French was spoken even by the Turks and
Saracens. The French themselves are said to have been in
love with their own language, and, as a result, to have
neglected Latin;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> when the English ambassador at Paris,
Sir Amias Poulet, sent to England for a chaplain for his
household, he wrote: "Yt were to be wished that he had at
the least some understandinge in the French tongue for his
better conference with the Frenche ministers, whereof many
are not best able to utter there mynde in Lattyn."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>We may therefore safely conclude that French was the
language commonly spoken by Englishmen in their intercourse
with foreigners, although Latin was sometimes used in conversation,
and Italians were occasionally addressed in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">-66-</a></span>own tongue. English was so little used in the Court and its
circles that foreigners were apt to forget that England had
a language of her own; one of them considers it a merit in
Henry VIII. that he was able to speak English! In London,
indeed, the use of French was so common that several foreign
observers deemed the fact worthy of note. Nicander Nucius,
the Greek envoy who visited London in 1545, remarks<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> that,
for the most part, the English use the French language, besides
having a great admiration for everything else French&mdash;an
observation which cannot safely be taken as referring to any
other class than the nobility, as his relations would be almost
wholly restricted to that class. When the Duke of Württemberg
visited the court of Elizabeth, where he found ample
occasion to exercise his own admirable knowledge of French,
he left on record the fact that many English courtiers understood
and spoke French very well. The spread of French at
the English Court attracted the attention of Frenchmen also,
and several years after Nicander's account, Peletier du Mans
states that in England, at least among the princes and their
courts, French is spoken on all occasions.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>French was also not infrequently used in correspondence.
Apart from such diplomatic correspondence as exists, numerous
examples of the interchange of private letters in French
among the English nobility have come down to us. Even
among scholars Latin was by no means the only medium of
communication. In the sixteenth century the chief scholars
of the two countries corresponded with each other, and, though
Englishmen never wrote in their native tongue, Frenchmen
did occasionally use their own language rather than Latin.
Bacon wrote in French to the Marquis of Effiat, and Hotman,
on the other hand, in French to Camden: "Me sentant
detraqué de l'usage de la langue latine, je vous escris cette
lettre en françois pour renouveller avec vous notre amitié
ancienne et correspondance."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> John Calvin corresponded
with Edward VI. and Protector Somerset in French, and
Henry IV. of France carried on a voluminous correspondence
in his own language with his "tres chere et tres aimée bonne

French
was thus more than a mere accomplishment for the English
gentleman, and soon became an absolute necessity for all
those who desired employment under the Crown. It is true
that an interpreter might be had, but the practice was looked
upon with great disfavour as very unsuitable where private
negotiations had to be conducted. The necessity for a knowledge
of French on the part of a minister of state may be
gathered from the large number of petitions and other documents
addressed to them in that language and preserved
among the State Papers.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> A rather curious instance of the
favour with which the use of French was regarded in official
circles is supplied by the case of a Scotch prisoner in London,
who, when he desired leave on parole, on the ground of ill-health,
was advised to make his application in French, "to
shew his scholarship."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Copies of proclamations, issued in
foreign countries, were frequently translated into French
before being sent to the English Government; and time after
time we find a lack of knowledge of French regarded as a
serious disqualification for diplomatic or other public service.
One young gentleman regrets that he "cannot be engaged
on any work of importance as he does not know French."
The drawbacks arising from an inadequate knowledge of the
language appear from the case of a certain Thomas Thyrleby
who writes from Valance to Wriothesly in 1538 telling him
how much discouraged he is concerning his knowledge of
French. He says he went with the Bishop of Winchester
and Brian to the Constable that morning at eight o'clock,
and that he could understand them, but not the Grand
Master's answer, except by conjecture, guessing at a word
here and there; after dinner he had audience of the French
king and bore away never one word but "l'empereur,
l'empereur" often rehearsed; and he feels he must diligently
apply himself to learn the language or the king will be ill
served when he is left alone.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The Tudors appear to have regarded the study of French
with much favour. The first king of this line had lived for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">-68-</a></span>many years in France and was strongly imbued with French
tastes.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> He encouraged Frenchmen to visit England, and
appointed one of them, Bernard André, his Poet Laureate and
Historiographer as well as tutor to his sons. There were also
troupes of French comedians and minstrels who performed at
Court from time to time.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The king always received with
favour at his Court those who were fluent in the French
tongue. No doubt Stephen Hawes secured the king's patronage
partly by his facility in the use of this language, and
partly from his really profound knowledge of French literature,
of which the king also was an eager student. Yet this first
of the Tudor kings belongs rather to the Middle Ages and the
Old Learning than to the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Not until we reach the period of Henry VIII., a distinct
favourer of the New Learning, do we enter fully into the spirit
of the new movement. In a true sense Henry may be called
the first King of England, for England was his real home,
and while using the ancient title "King of France," he had
no truly filial attachment to the country. He may thus be
taken as a fair example of the attitude of the cultivated English
noble towards foreign languages. He spoke French fluently
though he had never been in France, and also conversed in
Latin with ease; Italian he understood, but made no attempt
to speak. He always addressed foreigners in either French
or Latin.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> An admirer of French fashions, he copied in such
matters his friend and rival, the French king, even allowing
his beard to grow when he heard that Francis wore one, and
having his hair dressed "short and straight after the French
fashion." When the Venetian ambassador, Piero Pasqualigo,
came from Paris to London in 1515, Henry eagerly seized the
opportunity to institute a comparison between himself and the
French king. Pasqualigo, meeting Henry at Greenwich, writes
how he on one occasion beheld his majesty mounted on a bay
Frieslander, and dressed entirely in green velvet; directly
the envoy came in sight, he began to make his horse to curvet
and perform such feats, that Pasqualigo says he thought
himself looking upon Mars. He came into our tent, the
narrator continues, and, addressing me in French, said, "Talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">-69-</a></span>with me a while."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
<span class="sidenote">HENRY VIII.'S KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH</span>Henry then proceeded to question him
about Francis and to induce him to draw comparisons between
himself and the French king. The ambassador remarks that
Henry spoke French "very well indeed." The campaign of
1513 supplies another example of the ease with which Henry
spoke French. The English king was accompanied by
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, who later incurred the royal anger
by his presumption in marrying Henry's sister Mary, the
Dowager of France. On the present occasion, however,
the king's knowledge of French was of great service to
Suffolk, who found some difficulty in pressing his suit with
the Lady Margaret of Savoy, owing to his ignorance of that
language. The Duke had half seriously removed a ring from
the lady's finger, and, as she particularly desired to reclaim
it, and he refused to return it, she called him a thief; but he
could not understand the word "larron," so she was forced
to call upon the king to explain.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>There are extant several examples of Henry's compositions
in French. Much of his private correspondence was written
in this tongue; and he also essayed to write verses in French,
possibly in imitation of Francis I. Their quality may be
judged from the following specimens:<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p class="noi">We gather from Henry's spelling of French that he had learnt
the language chiefly by ear.</p>

<p>There is a curious example of the fluency with which the
king and his courtiers spoke French, in a scene described by
Wolsey's gentleman usher and afterwards dramatized by
Shakespeare.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The cardinal was among the few at the
Court of Henry VIII. who did not speak French with ease.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">-70-</a></span>During a banquet he was giving at the palace of Whitehall,
Henry and a band of courtiers landed unexpectedly at the
Whitehall Stairs, disguised as foreign noblemen. Wolsey sent
the Lord Chancellor to bid them welcome, because he could
not speak French himself.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The visitors were introduced,
and passed for a time as foreigners, the Lord Chancellor
acting as their interpreter to Wolsey. At last the royal joker
and his companions disclosed their identity amidst a tumult
of exclamations, and then joined in the festivities.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The ladies of the Court rivalled the noblemen in their
knowledge of French. When the French ambassadors with
their brilliant suite, who had come to England for the
ratification of peace in 1514, were entertained in great
state at Greenwich, all the ladies and gentlewomen were
able to converse in good French with their French partners,
"which delighted them much to heare the Ladies speake to
them in their owne language."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> It is not surprising, therefore,
to find French holding an important place in the education
of women of high birth. The princess Mary Tudor, one of
the most attractive figures at the English Court, had,
like the king her brother, been early initiated in the
difficulties of the French language.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> At the age of twelve
she pronounced in French her betrothal vows to the
Prince of Castile (1513); and when it fell to her lot to marry
Louis XII. of France, she continued still more to apply
herself to the study of the language. She was able to
write to her future husband in his own tongue,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and even
occasionally made use of it in her correspondence with her
brother, the English king.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FRENCH AMONG THE LADIES</span>Henry's first queen did little to forward French tastes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">-71-</a></span>
never modified her natural preference for all things Spanish,
but with the advent of Queen Anne Boleyn French acquired
a powerful and enthusiastic patroness. Anne was entirely
French by education and tastes. She had been brought
up by a French governess,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and had from an early age
used the French language in her correspondence with her
father during his absences at the Court and elsewhere. It
was her fluency in this language which led to her rapid
advancement on her arrival at Court. She was soon chosen
to accompany the king's sister Mary to France, and just
before her appointment wrote to her father in French,
telling him that the presence of the Queen of France would
inspire her with a still greater desire to speak French well.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
Anne stayed in France several years, first in the service of
Mary during the few months she was Queen of France, then
in that of her successor, Queen Claude, consort of Francis I.,
and finally in the more lively household of Margaret of Alençon,
afterwards Queen of Navarre. On her return to the English
Court she became maid of honour to Queen Katherine,
and her skill in dress and her French manners<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> did much
to promote the taste for French fashions. The famous
Elizabethan antiquary Camden asserts that Anne's French
jollity first attracted to her the notice of Henry. At any
rate the courtship was largely carried on in French. Out of
the seventeen love letters of Henry to Anne Boleyn, which
are preserved in the Vatican Library, more than half are in
French.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> One of these may be quoted as an example of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">-72-</a></span>English king's powers in French prose. It was written to
Anne during one of the absences she deemed expedient to
make from the Court:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ma Maitresse et amie, moy et mon c&#339;ur s'en remettent en vos mains,
vous suppliant les avoir pour recommander a votre bonne grace, et que par

H. R.</p></div>

<p>Of Henry's other queens, Jane Seymour and Katherine
Howard were both ardent admirers of the French language.
The former had, like Anne Boleyn, completed her education at
the French Court. Henry's chief objection to Anne of Cleves
was her lack of French refinements. We know from the French
ambassador Marillac that Henry was ill pleased at Anne's
German costume and made her dress in the French style,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
which, according to the same authority, had been favoured
by Queen Katherine Howard and all her ladies. Moreover,
the new queen could speak neither French<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> nor English, and
her own language was displeasing to the king's ears; consequently
he refused to converse much with her by means
of an interpreter.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> As for Katharine Parr, she was one of
the most distinguished linguists of her time, and did much
to encourage the studies of the royal family.</p>

<p>French was one of the principal studies of Henry VIII.'s
children. It appears to have been the only modern foreign
language with which Edward VI. was acquainted; he is said
to have been "in the French and Latin Tongues singularly
perfect."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Mary, on the other hand, knew Spanish as well
as she did French. This is, however, accounted for by the
fact that she was early destined to become the wife of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">-73-</a></span>Emperor Charles V.
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH STUDIED IN THE ROYAL FAMILY</span>The emperor had even tried to persuade
Henry to allow his daughter to be brought up in Spain.
His request was refused, but a promise was given that the
princess should be educated in all points as a Spanish lady.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
In addition to this, her mother, Katherine of Aragon, superintended
her early education, and her attendants were all
Spanish. Thus Spanish was for a time almost her native
tongue. Yet French was by no means neglected, especially
after the Spanish marriage was broken off. Fresh impetus
was given to this study by the possibility of a French
match, when in 1518 negotiations for a union with the
Dauphin, son of Francis I., were set on foot. On the testimony
of Marillac, Mary spoke and wrote French well; the
ambassador had seen letters of hers written in French at the
time of her mother's divorce.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The princess was also well
acquainted with Latin, and understood Italian, though, like
many others, she did not attempt to speak it.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth alone of the royal family spoke Italian with
almost as much ease as she did French.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> "French and Italian
she speaks like English," wrote her tutor, Roger Ascham,
"Latin with fluency, propriety, and judgment"; and in
addition she had some knowledge of Greek. When queen, she
retained her early fancy for Italian, and prided herself on
using no other language in the presence of Italians.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The
Scotch ambassador, Sir James Melville, a very competent
judge, remarks that she spoke it "raisonable weill."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> French,
however, was her usual means of intercourse with other
foreigners, even when, like Melville, they spoke English. The
queen commended Melville's French. "She said my French
was gud," he writes in his memoirs, where he likewise gives
his own opinion of the queen's attainments in the language:
"hir Maiestie culd speak as gud Frenche as any that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">-74-</a></span>never bene out of the contrie, but yet she laiketh the use of
the Frenche court language, quhilk was frank and schort and
had oft tymes twa significations, quhilk discreit and famylier
frendes tok always in the best part."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> If not idiomatic, the
queen's French is generally allowed to have been fluent.
Her accent is reported to have been harsh and unpleasing;
she spoke with a drawl, and, according to M. Drizanval,
resident in London for the French king,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> she constantly
repeated the phrase "<i>paar Dieu, paar maa foi</i>" in a
ridiculous tone. Another visitor, the Duke of Württemberg,
records that he once heard her deliver an appropriate speech
in French,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> which, as usual, was the language in which he
addressed her. Towards the end of her reign the queen still
practised the use of French and Italian. In 1598 the German
Hentzner, travelling in England, describes how he saw
Elizabeth "as she went along in all her State and magnificence,"
and how "she spoke very graciously first to one then
to another (whether foreign ministers or those who attend
for different reasons) in English, French, and Italian."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> She
also wrote French with some ease. One of her earliest literary
efforts was a translation from the French of Margaret of
Navarre's <i>Miroir de l'Ame pécheresse</i>. She likewise composed
devotions and prayers in French&mdash;a habit which she retained
after she had been queen for many years. At the time when
her marriage with the Duke of Alençon, her "little frog," as
she calls him, was under discussion, the queen compiled a
curious little volume, containing six prayers, written on
vellum in a very neat hand; in addition to devotions in
French and English there are others in Italian, Latin, and
Greek. In the front of this work there is a miniature of the
Duke, and at the end, one of Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Other examples
of her compositions in French are found in her correspondence,
where this language holds a considerable place.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the majority of the English nobility
and gentry spoke and understood French at least tolerably well.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">-75-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH TUTORS AND FRENCH GRAMMARS</span>We are led to ask how they came by their knowledge, and
what facilities there were in England for learning French, seeing
that many of them never visited France. In the sixteenth
century private tuition played a large part in the education
of the gentry; and the professional tutor was, in many cases,
a Frenchman, who would naturally further the study of his
native tongue. The Court itself encouraged the custom of
employing French tutors by engaging several in its midst;
and as, at this time, the Court became a powerful factor in
English social life, and the chief means of entering the service
of the State, noblemen and gentlemen wishing to figure on
the social stage endeavoured to adapt themselves to Court
requirements. French tutors were to be found in all the chief
families of the time. Étienne Pasquier remarks that there
was no noble family in England without its French tutor to
instruct the children in the French language.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> This condition
of things was still further developed a few years later when
religious persecution in France and the Netherlands drove
increasingly large numbers of Protestant refugees to take
asylum in England. All traces of the majority of these tutors
have been lost; those of whom anything is known were, for
the most part, either the authors of manuals for teaching
French, or had won repute as writers or Humanists before
leaving their native land.</p>

<p>One of these Humanists was Bernard André, familiarly
called "Master Barnard," the blind poet&mdash;an infirmity to
which he frequently refers. He was a native of Toulouse,
and probably came to England with Henry VII., his
patron.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> It is a curious fact that soon after his accession
Henry appointed this Frenchman, author of verses in French
and Latin but never a line in English, Poet Laureate of
England. In addition to this he bestowed on him repeated
marks of favour. For a time André was engaged as a tutor
at Oxford, and in 1496 was chosen as governor to Prince
Arthur, and probably had much to do with the education
of his brother, afterwards Henry VIII. Appointed Historiographer
Royal, he began in this capacity to write his patron's
life. Like so many other men of education, André was in
Holy Orders; he received preferment from time to time, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-76-</a></span>was finally presented to the living of Guisnes near Calais, which
he resigned in 1521, having attained an "extreme old age."</p>

<p>In the early sixteenth century, as in the Middle Ages,
England took the initiative in the production of French
grammars.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The numbers which appeared are so many
testimonies to Englishmen's interest in the French language.
The chief and best known of these grammars is the great
work of John Palsgrave (1530), already mentioned, which
stands out in contrast with the slight treatises which
had previously appeared on the subject in England. Considering
the time when it was written and the irregular and
unsettled condition of the language with which it deals, it
is truly remarkable for its fulness and comprehensiveness.
Almost alone of its predecessors and its immediate successors,
it answered more than a merely temporary and professional
purpose, and is still of very great value to the student of the
English and French languages at that time, and a great
storehouse of obsolete words in both languages. Perhaps the
very reason which makes it so valuable to the student of
to-day hindered its success in the sixteenth century; most
students of French then preferred the shorter and more practical
manuals. Palsgrave had a very exalted idea of the French
tongue; he desired to place it on a level with the "three
perfect tonges"&mdash;Latin, Greek, and Hebrew&mdash;and to make
it a fourth and classical tongue, by drawing up "absolute"
rules for its use.</p>

<p>Palsgrave's grammar acquires additional importance from
the fact that no similar work had been produced in France.
It is the first systematized attempt to formulate rules for the
French language, or indeed for any modern tongue. Only one
year later, however, Sylvius or Dubois published his <i>In Linguam
Gallicam Eisagoge</i> (1531). In the address to Henry VIII.,
which precedes his work, Palsgrave speaks of the "great
nombre of clerkes, whiche before season of this mater have
written nowe sithe the beginnyng of your most fortunate and
most prosperous raigne." All these "clerkes," he says, have
treated chiefly of two things, which they judged specially
useful to the English&mdash;the pronunciation of French, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">-77-</a></span>"wherein the true analogie of the two tongues did rest."
<span class="sidenote">BARCLAY'S "INTRODUCTORY"</span>No doubt many of these treatises were in manuscript and
are among the lost treasures of the sixteenth century. Yet
some have come down to us. Palsgrave mentions three
writers by name, Alexander Barclay, Petrus Vallensys, and
Giles Duwes, copies of whose works are still in existence.</p>

<p>The earliest of these grammars&mdash;so far as is known the first
French grammar ever printed&mdash;was the work of Alexander
Barclay, well known as a prolific writer and poet, who devoted
much of his time to translation and did much to make contemporary
French literature known in England. Barclay
had spent a time "full of foly and unprofytable stody" at
some university, possibly Paris; he had travelled, and was
well acquainted with French; from his youth upwards, he
says, he had been exercised in the two languages of French
and English. It was late in his literary career, when he had
"withdrawen" his pen from its "olde dylygence," that he
undertook to compose a grammar of the French language,
at the request of the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Treasurer of
England, and of "certain other gentlemen." The work
appeared in 1521<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> under the title of <i>Here begynneth the introductory
to wryte and to pronounce frenche compyled by Alexander
Barclay, compendiously at the commandement of the right hye
excellent and myghty prynce, Th. duke of Northfolke</i>. The
printer, Robert Coplande, himself a good French scholar,
composed some lines on the coat of arms of the Duke in
French, and printed them at the beginning of the book; at the
end he placed a translation of Lambert Danneau's <i>Traité des
Danses</i>, also from his own pen.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Barclay's endeavour is to make his grammar as short and
concise as possible; his rules, so far as they go, are stated
very clearly; he plunges straight away into his subject without
any preliminary observations: "<i>je</i> in frenche," he
begins, "is as moche to say in english as I, <i>tu</i>, thou, <i>il</i>, he,
<i>nous</i>, <i>vous</i>, <i>ilz</i> or <i>els</i>: we may use sometyme <i>ceux</i> for this
worde <i>ilz</i>. If we answere to a question by this worde 'I'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">-78-</a></span>usynynge no verbe withall then shall not '<i>ie</i>' be set for 'I'
but '<i>moy</i>,' as in this example, '<i>qui fist ce livre</i>' ... If I sholde
answere saynge I, addynge no verbe withall, I must say
'<i>moy</i>,' and not '<i>ie</i>.'" After giving similar rules for the second
person singular, he proceeds to explain how, when the words
<i>nous</i>, <i>vous</i>, <i>ilz</i> are placed before a verb beginning with a
consonant, their last consonant is not pronounced, although
it remains in the spelling; but if they come before a verb
beginning with a vowel, the consonants are pronounced.
He then turns to the conjugation of the two auxiliaries and
some of the most common irregular verbs, to show "how
these pronouns are ioyned with verbes." On the back of
folio 4 he begins his "introductory of orthography or true
wrytynge wherby the diligent reder may be infourmed truly
and perfytely to wryte and pronounce the Frenche tunge
after the dyvers customes of many contress of France."
Barclay, then, does not adopt an exclusive attitude towards
provincial accents; he rather calls attention to them,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> though
probably merely stating facts and drawing distinctions with
no intention of teaching provincial forms. Palsgrave, on
the other hand, deals only with the French spoken between
the Seine and the Loire, which he regarded as the only pure
French. Barclay's attitude to dialectal forms may possibly
be explained by the fact that he transcribed freely from the
mediaeval treatises, especially the <i>Donait françois</i> of John
Barton. His debt was early noted by Palsgrave, who wrote:
"I have sene an olde boke written in parchment, in all thynges
lyke to his sayd <i>Introductory</i>, whiche, by conjecture, was not
unwritten this hundred yeares."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> So freely, indeed, and so
carelessly did Barclay use his sources, that he did not even
trouble to modernize the spelling, which contains many obsolete
forms; in this connexion Palsgrave, who criticizes
Barclay very severely when occasion arises,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> remarks on his
use of <i>k</i> for <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Having exemplified the pronunciation of some of the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-79-</a></span>letters by comparison with English sounds,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Barclay suddenly<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
passes to the consideration of the number and gender
of nouns,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> besides supplying a short list of nouns beginning
with the first two letters of the alphabet. After this digression
he concludes his observations on the pronunciation,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
and proceeds to give an alphabetical vocabulary of nouns,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
adjectives and verbs, apparently the earliest known attempt
at an alphabetical French-English vocabulary; the earlier
method of arranging words under headings is discarded,
though it continued to be the usual form adopted in most
French grammars until the end of the eighteenth century.
Barclay's vocabulary consists of a list of words pure and
simple, with no indication of gender or flexions. The <i>Introductory</i>
ends with lists of ordinal numerals, days, seasons,
and so on, together with words of learned origin common to
both languages "amonge eloquent men," and, last of all,
pieces of prose composition in both French and English,
arranged in alternate lines.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>As is usual in these early grammars, there is an obvious
lack of orderly arrangement, and the work, as a whole,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-80-</a></span>gives the impression of being a collection of rough notes
rather than a carefully planned treatise. Barclay does not,
however, make any claim to completeness, nor pretend to
lay down "absolute" rules as Palsgrave claimed to do. He
shared the opinion, common at that time among Frenchmen,
that it was impossible to formulate anything like adequate
rules for the French language. The sketchy nature of his
rules may be judged by that given for the position of the
objective pronoun: "oft times that thynge whiche cometh
before the verbe in Englyshe commyth after it in frenche
as il m'a fait tort . . . je ne me puis lever." He was
of opinion that rules were not of much use in learning
French: that language is best learnt by "custome and use
of redynge and spekynge, by often enquirynge and frequentynge
of company of frenchmen and of suche as have perfytnes
in spekynge the sayd language." This opinion prevailed
throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in England,
and, as a result, rules are reduced to a minimum in manuals
for teaching French.</p>

<p>"Who so desyreth to knowe more of the sayd language,
must provyde for mo bokes made for the same intent," Barclay
notes at the end of his short and interesting treatise. Charles,
Duke of Suffolk, the husband of Mary, sister to Henry VIII.
and Dowager Queen of France, was soon to make the necessary
provision. This "syngular good lorde," says Palsgrave, "by
cause that my poore labours required a longe tracte of tyme,
hath also in the meane season encouraged maister Petrus
Vallensys, scole maister to his excellent yong sonne the Erle
of Lyncolne to shewe his lernynge and opinion on this
behalfe." Such was the origin of the <i>Introductions in Frensche
for Henry the Yonge Erle of Lyncoln (childe of greate esperaunce)
sonne of the most noble and excellent princesse Mary (by the
grace of God, queen of France etc.)</i>,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> which is undated and
anonymous, but clearly the work of Petrus Vallensys or Pierre
Valence, French tutor to the Earl of Lincoln, and must have
been written sometime in the third decade of the century.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
Valence is said to have taught French after a "wonderesly
compendious facile prompte and ready waye,"<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and Gregory
Cromwell, whom he also counted among his pupils, is reported
to have made good progress under his direction. Pierre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">-81-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">PIERRE VALENCE, TEACHER OF FRENCH</span>Valence was one of the natives of Normandy, so numerous
in England at this time that the fact was commented on by
Étienne Perlin, a French priest who visited England at the
end of the reign of Edward VI. He describes them as being
"du tout tres mechans et mauditz François," worse than
all the English, which, according to him, is a very grave
charge.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The date at which Valence came to England is
unknown, but he is said to have studied at Cambridge in or
about 1515.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> He was in all probability a refugee for religious
reasons. He is known to have held Lutheran opinions, and,
whilst at Cambridge, caused a disturbance by defacing a copy
of the Pope's general indulgence, which had been set up
over the gates of the schools. Vigorous but ineffectual attempts
were made to discover the writer, against whom the
Chancellor pronounced sentence of excommunication. Valence
is alleged finally to have acknowledged the act as his, to have
expressed contrition, and to have been absolved. There are
several points of contact between this man and his greater
contemporary, John Palsgrave: both were students at Cambridge,
possibly at the same time, though Palsgrave was
the senior; both had as their pupil the son of Mr. Secretary
Cromwell&mdash;the one for French and the other for Latin;
both were protégés of the Dowager Queen of France (sister
of Henry VIII. and Palsgrave's pupil for French) and of her
husband the Duke of Suffolk. In 1535 Valence received a
grant of letters of denization,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and ultimately became domestic
chaplain and almoner to Dr. Goodrich, Bishop of Ely, and
appears to have maintained this position under the bishop's
successor. He was still living in 1555, since, in that year, he
visited some heretics in Ely jail, and conjured them to stand
loyally by the truth of the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Among the works of "dyvers clerkes" on the French language,
to which Palsgrave refers, is probably to be reckoned
a short treatise bearing the date 1528. This work is only
known by a fragment consisting of two leaves now preserved in
the library at Lambeth.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> These pages are of quarto size and
bear the signature "B. B." The right-hand page is in French,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-82-</a></span>the left in English; the former is in Roman characters, the
latter in black letter. Although these two pages contain the
date, and the last is not full, they do not appear to be the end
of the work, as the writer refers to what is to come hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
One gathers from internal evidence that the author was a
foreigner&mdash;no doubt a Frenchman. He speaks, for instance,
of the "gentz Englois" as though he was not one of them;
and it appears to be quite certain that the work was originally
composed in French, and translated into English rather carelessly,
and probably by another hand, for in the version it is
rendered almost unintelligible by the translation of the French
illustrative examples as well as the text itself.</p>

<p>The contents are of a light and entertaining character.
The author holds that many rules do but "trouble and
marre" the understanding. He counsels students rather to
follow the example of good writers as likely to be more
helpful.</p>

<p>He treats entirely of the pronunciation, and devotes
special attention to the difficulties of the English,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> laying
emphasis on the importance of placing the accent on the
right syllable. The rules are put in an amusing way,
thus: "<i>a</i> should be pronounced fro the botom of the
stomake and all openly, <i>e</i> a lytell higher in the throte
there properly where the Englishman soundeth his <i>e</i>; <i>i</i>, in
the roundnesse of the lippes; <i>u</i>, in puttynge a lytell of wynde
out of the mouthe." Further uses of the vowel <i>a</i> are
thus set forth: it may be placed before all verbs, in the
infinitive mood, and before all manner of nouns and pronouns,
as "to Robert," "to May," and so on. Again, "it betokeneth
'have' when it cometh of the Latin verb <i>habeo</i>." The consonants
are next dealt with and disposed of in much the same
way. Some attention is also given to the question, then much
discussed, whether the etymological consonants in the words
where they are not pronounced should be retained or not. The
author's opinion was that every letter in a word ought to be
sounded, yet he feels himself utterly unable to struggle against
custom, and falls back on the rule "go as you please":

<span class="sidenote">TWO FRENCH POETS TEACH FRENCH</span>"Pronounce ech one as he shal please, for to difficyl it is to
correct olde errours."</p>

<p>Among the French teachers in England at this time were
also two Frenchmen of considerable literary distinction&mdash;Nicolas
Bourbon, the Latin poet and well-known scholar,
friend of Rabelais and Marot; and Nicolas Denisot, who
likewise held an important place among French humanists,
and finished his literary education under Daurat, the famous
Hellenist.</p>

<p>Bourbon came to England under the protection of Anne
Boleyn, who appears to have taken a special interest in him;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
she had, he tells us, procured his liberation from imprisonment.
Bourbon was for some time a private tutor in Paris, and soon
after he regained his freedom he crossed to England, intending
to continue his work there. He had a cordial welcome, and
invariably speaks of his stay and treatment in London with
gratitude. His Latin verses<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> show him to be acquainted
with the chief Englishmen who gathered round the Court,
where he occupied his leisure by writing satirical verses
against the queen's enemies, especially Sir Thomas More,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
and in eulogizing Cromwell, Cranmer, and the Reform Party
then in power. It was on the recommendation of the king
and queen, he informs us, that he was engaged as French
tutor in several families of distinction, including the Carews,
Norrisses, and Harveys. John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland,
was one of his patrons, and from him Robert Dudley,
afterwards Earl of Leicester, together with his brothers,
learnt French as children. Bourbon left England in 1535, on
hearing of the death of his father. He had probably been in
the country at least two years, and, perhaps happily for
himself, left it a year before the fall of his patroness Anne
Boleyn.</p>

<p>At a somewhat later date, 1547, the elegant poet and artist
Nicolas Denisot arrived in England, driven from Paris by
an unfortunate love affair.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> His nephew, Jacques Denisot,
declares he was "fort bien accueilliz dans la cour d'Angleterre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">-84-</a></span>où son estime et sa reputation estoit deja cogneue." He mixed
with the writers and politicians<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> of the day, and attracted
the notice of the Court by writing verses in honour of the
young king, Edward VI.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> He soon found himself in the
distinguished position of French and Latin tutor to the three
daughters of the Protector Somerset,&mdash;Anne, Margaret, and
Jane,&mdash;who were destined shortly to become famous in Paris
as his pupils, and to form an important link in the literary
relations of the two countries. Calvin corresponded with one
of Denisot's pupils, the Lady Anne; and in 1549 he wrote
requesting her to use her knowledge of French in transmitting
to her mother an expression of his gratitude for a ring he had
received from that lady, he being unable to do so, on account
of his ignorance of English.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> In this same year, 1549,
Denisot's engagement in the house of Somerset came to
an end rather abruptly, probably on account of some misunderstanding
with the duke. He returned to France after
spending three years in England, and thence kept up a friendly
correspondence with his former pupils. On the death of
Queen Margaret of Navarre, whom, no doubt, Denisot had
taught them to admire, the sisters composed four hundred
Latin distichs in her honour, and sent them to their former
master, who welcomed them with enthusiasm, and published
them in 1550. In the following year the verses appeared
again, accompanied by French, Italian, and Greek translations,
and verses from the pen of Ronsard, Du Bellay, and other
literary friends of Denisot.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> It is a striking fact that before
the Pléiade was fully known in France, the fame of some of
its members had reached England, where a particular interest
would be taken in this development of the work of the three
princesses. Ronsard, Denisot's intimate friend, wrote one
of his earliest odes in honour of Denisot's pupils, in which he
celebrates the intellectual union of France and England:</p>

<p class="noi">Herberay des Essarts, the translator of the famous <i>Amadis</i>,
wrote a letter in praise of the princesses, which was printed
at the beginning of Margaret's "tombeau." With full justice
has Denisot been called the "ambassador" of the French
Renaissance in England.</p>

The chronicler Harrison remarks that it is a rare thing to hear of a courtier that has
but his own language, and to tell how many ladies are skilled in French, Spanish, and
Italian is beyond his power (<i>Holinshed's Chronicle</i>, 1586, i. p. 196). Nicholas Udal
writes in the same strain in his dedication to Queen Katherine Parr of his translation of
Erasmus's <i>Paraphrase of the Gospels</i>; we are told that a great number of noble
women at that time in England were given to the study of human sciences and of
strange tongues; and that it was a common thing to see "young virgins so nouzled
and trained in the study of letters that thei willingly set all other vain pastymes at
nought for learnynge's sake." Amongst the most accomplished of such "Queens and
Ladies of high estate and progeny" were Queen Katherine Parr and Lady Jane Grey.
Mulcaster in his <i>Positions</i> (1581) praises English ladies for their fondness of serious
study, and so does the Italian teacher Torriano in his <i>Italian reviv'd</i> (1673), p. 99.
Many examples of fluent linguists are found in Ballard's <i>Memoirs of Several Ladies of
Great Britain</i>, 2nd ed., 1775.</p></div>

Dr. William Turner in the dedication of his <i>Herbal</i> (1568) to the queen, addresses her
thus: "As to your knowledge of Latin and Greek, French, Italian, and others also,
not only your own faythful subiectes, beynge far from all suspicion of flattery, bear
witness, but also strangers, men of great learninge, in their books set out in Latin tonge,
give honourable testimonye." Best known of these learned observers was Scaliger
(<i>Scaligeriana</i>, Cologne, 1695, p. 134). Similar eulogies in verse were left by French
poets: Ronsard, <i>Elegies, Mascarades et Bergeries</i> (1561), reproduced in <i>Le Bocage
royal</i> (1567); Jacques Grévin, <i>Chant du cygne</i>; Du Bartas, <i>Second Week</i>; and
Agrippa d'Aubigné; also by John Florio, <i>First Frutes</i>, 1578, ch. xiii.</p></div>

ignorance of French at times. Such is his advice to those who accompanied him on
his embassy to France: "The nature of the Frenchmen is such that at their first
meeting they will be as familiar with you as if they had knowne you by long acquaintance,
and will commune with you in their French Tongue as if you knew every word.
Therefore use them in a kind manner, and bee as familiar with them as they are with
you: if they speake to you in their natural tongue, speake to them in English, for if
you understand not them, no more shall they you." Puttenham, in his <i>Arte of English
Poesie</i>, advises ambassadors and messengers not to use foreign languages of which
they have not perfect command, lest they commit blunders similar to that of the
courtier who said of a French lady, "Elle chevauche bien,"&mdash;blunders which might
have serious results in diplomatic transactions.</p></div>

<h3>FRENCH TUTORS AT COURT&mdash;GILES DUWES&mdash;JOHN PALSGRAVE&mdash;JEAN
BELLEMAIN</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> two most popular French tutors at the Court of Henry
VIII. were undoubtedly Giles Duwes and John Palsgrave.
Palsgrave is the only one of these early French tutors who is
well known to-day as a writer on the French tongue. He
was a Londoner, and received his education at Cambridge
and Paris. Giles Duwes was a Frenchman and seems to have
enjoyed a greater popularity in his own day. He had been
teaching French at the English Court for over ten years when
Palsgrave received his first appointment there, as French
tutor to the king's "most dere and entierly beloved" sister
Mary, afterwards Queen of France. Both teachers were
protégés of Henry VIII., and taught in the royal family&mdash;Duwes
was tutor to the king himself; and both were authors
of grammars of the French language. That of Palsgrave has
been mentioned already. It appeared in 1530 under the title
of <i>L'Esclarcissement de la langue françoyse</i>. Duwes's was not
published till three years later approximately, at the request of
his pupil, Princess Mary, afterwards Queen of England. It was
called <i>An Introductorie for to learne to rede, to prononce and to
speke French trewly, compyled for the rigid high excellent and
most vertuous Lady Mary of Englande, daughter to our most
gracious soveraign, Lorde Kyng Henry the Eight</i>.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> His treatise
is a small quarto of 102 leaves, forming a striking contrast
to Palsgrave's enormous folio<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> of over 1000 pages.</p>

<p>The contents and style of the two books are as different
as their size. Like all the French grammarians of the time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-87-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">JOHN PALSGRAVE'S FRENCH GRAMMAR</span>Palsgrave opens his work with rules for the pronunciation,
and the whole of the first book is devoted to an elaborate
study of this subject. Earlier writers had treated it very
slightly, if at all, trusting that the student would find some
opportunity of learning the sounds of the language by mixing
with those who spoke it. We are told<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> that as a result there
was no means of acquiring a good pronunciation, save in
early youth by practice and use for a year or two. And it
came to be supposed in a manner a thing impossible; "in
so much that whereas there be hundreds in this realm, which
with a little labour and the aid of Latin, do so perfectly
understand this tongue that they be able to translate at the
first sight anything out of the French tongue into ours, yet
have they thought the thing so strange to leave the consonants
unsounded whiche they saw written in such books
as they studied, that they have utterly neglected the Frenchmen's
manner of pronunciation, and so read French as their
fantasy or opinion did lead them and, by that means, perceiving
in themselves a want and swerving from the truth,
which they wot not how to amend, utterly leave to speak or
exercise the language as a thing which they despair of."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
One of the chief difficulties of these early students then was
the numerous consonants found in French words for etymological
reasons, and which were not pronounced. Other
difficulties were found in the accentuation of vowel sounds.
The English were in the habit of placing the accent on the
wrong syllable, saying <i>d&#333;ucement</i> instead of <i>doucem&#275;nt</i>, and
of not giving the vowel its full and pure sound, both mistakes
being due to peculiarities of their native tongue. "We must
leave that kind of reading and pronouncing if we will sound
the French Tongue aright," says Palsgrave, "for the French in
their pronunciation do chiefly regard three things: to be
armonious in theyr speking, to be brefe and sodayne in
soundyng of theyr words, avoydyng all manner of harshenesse
in theyr pronunciation, and thirdly to gyve every worde that
they abyde and reste upon theyr most audible sounde."
There is something solemn about his assurance of the successful
results to be attained by the study of his rules: "whereas
nowe the very grounde and consyderation of the Frenchmen
in this behalf ones knowen, it hath been proved by experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-88-</a></span>that it is but a senyghts labour, or, at the most, a fournyghtes
to lerne this poynt concernyng to theyr pronounciatyon an
to be sure herof for ever."</p>

<p>Palsgrave devotes attention to each letter of the alphabet
in turn, and seeks to elucidate the value of the sounds by
reference to contemporary English or Italian, and by attempting
to give the position of the vocal organs.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> <i>A</i>, he says,
has two diverse sounds. "Sometimes he is sounded as in
English, and sometimes like the diphthong <i>au</i> and a little
in the nose. The most usual pronunciation given it by the
French, is the same as those who speak the best English, that
is like the Italian sound <i>a</i>, or those of the English who sound
the Latin tongue aright. When <i>m</i> or <i>n</i> follow the vowel it
is pronounced as <i>au</i> and somewhat in the nose, <i>chambre</i> being
sounded <i>chaumbre</i>," etc. More general topics are also touched
on&mdash;the accent, the length of vowels, and the intonation which
is so "brief, so sudden and so hard."</p>

<p>In his second book,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Palsgrave treats what he calls the
second difficulty of the French tongue&mdash;the accidence of the
nine parts of speech. Throughout, constant reference is
made to the third book, "whiche is a very comment expositour
unto my second." This last book deals with the more
syntactical side of the subject, and was added on the model of
Theodore Gaza's Greek grammar. It occupies by far the largest
portion of the whole work,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> and besides giving elaborate and
often obscure rules to govern every French inflexion,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> includes
an English-French alphabetical vocabulary which reaches the
size of a dictionary. This vocabulary is arranged according
to the parts of speech, and numerous phrases and idioms
illustrative of different uses of the words are freely given.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">-89-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">THE "INTRODUCTORIE" OF GILES DUWES</span>Nothing like it in dimensions had yet appeared, and, contrary
to custom, the English is placed before the French.</p>

<p>Duwes's manual, on the other hand, opens with an acrostich
in French with an interlinear English translation containing
the author's name&mdash;Giles Duwes or de Vadis,&mdash;followed by a
short address in verse to the Princess Mary, "filleule a saincte
Marie" (also in French, accompanied by an English interlinear
version), and lists of French words beginning with each of the
letters of his royal pupil's name. The grammar itself is
written in English, for Duwes was one of the few Frenchmen
of the time who knew English; neither Bourbon nor Denisot,
though they lived in England some years, and taught French
to English pupils, knew our language; and no doubt they
helped to continue the long-standing relation between the
teaching of Latin and the teaching of French. Duwes's
work is divided into two books, the first of which is devoted
to rules of grammar. He dismisses the pronunciation with
seven short and inadequate rules, and proceeds to give his
pupil a copious vocabulary of words and phrases, in which
the English word is printed over the French one. The headings
with which the earlier vocabularies have made us familiar
are again utilized, though with variety in detail, and many
passages are reminiscent of the mediaeval nomenclatures.
After his pupil has gained a knowledge of pronunciation, and
acquired a good vocabulary, Duwes proceeds to give him an
insight into the grammar of the language. He treats the
parts of speech, with the exception of the verb, in a very
summary fashion; thus, with regard to the gender of pronouns,
all he has to say is that those ending in <i>a</i> are feminine,
and those ending in <i>on</i> or <i>e</i> are masculine. "But there
be certain names of the feminine, which do require the pronouns
masculine, that must be accepted (excepted), as
<i>mon ame</i>; <i>me</i> and <i>se</i> be indifferent." He devotes nearly the
whole of his space to a lengthy and elaborate treatment of
the French verb, which he divides into two conjugations,
according as there is not or is an <i>s</i> before the termination
<i>-ons</i> of the first person plural, present indicative! Thus the
forms <i>aimons</i>, <i>avons</i>, <i>batons</i>, <i>donons</i> prove the verbs <i>aimer</i>,
<i>avoir</i>, <i>batir</i>, <i>donner</i> to belong to the first conjugation; and
similarly the forms <i>baisons</i>, <i>taisons</i>, etc., indicate that these
verbs belong to the second conjugation&mdash;an arrangement not
at all conducive to lucidity. A considerable part of his work
is occupied by the conjugation of verbs of all sorts, in a variety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">-90-</a></span>of forms and both negatively and interrogatively. He usually
adopts the practice, frequent in modern text-books, of attaching
words to the verbs as he conjugates them, and so providing
them with a context. Thus he writes <i>j'ai grand desir</i>, and
not simply the verb form <i>j'ai</i>. A knowledge of French verbs
was, in Duwes's opinion, the key to the knowledge of the
French language.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The second book occupies more than half the volume. It
contains practical exercises in the form of "letters missive
in prose and in rime, also diverse communications by way of
dialogue, to receive a messenger from the emperor, the French
King or any other prince, also other communications of the
propriety of meat, of love, of peace, of wars, of the exposition
of the mass, and what man's soul is, with the division of time
and other conceits." Each exercise is provided with an
interlinear English translation, and all, as may be gathered
from their subject matter, were in the first place written
specially for the use of the Princess Mary. They deal with the
daily events of her life, and, though occasionally public affairs
are touched on, these exercises are of greatest interest in
disclosing the affectionate relations existing between Mary
and her tutor. Whenever possible, Duwes introduces alternative
phrases as well as variations of number and gender, and
this attention to his pupil's vocabulary and knowledge of the
flexions often encumbers his sentences. As for the English
version, it gives a word-for-word rendering of the French,
without regard to the natural order of words in an English
sentence.</p>

<p>The methods of the two teachers seem to have been as
different as their works. Everything tends to prove that
Duwes's manner of teaching was practical, light, and entertaining,
and at the same time efficient&mdash;a rare combination
of good qualities. Henry VIII.'s skill in French has already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">-91-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">HIS METHOD</span>been noticed, and Duwes's other pupils seem to have been
equally accomplished. In his opinion, a good vocabulary
and a thorough knowledge of the verbs were the two essentials
in teaching French. To learn French quickly, he thinks, the
student must practise turning the verbs in all possible ways,
affirmatively, negatively, and interrogatively&mdash;a principle of
repetition. In this way he acquires fluency of speech and is
able to "make diverse and many sentences with one word,
and perconsequent come shortly to the French speach." For
instance, thirty-six variations may be got in one tense, by
turning each person in six different ways, "that is to say,
the affirmative three ways, and the negative likewise." Duwes
reaches this large total by giving the following forms of each
person: "I have, have I?, why have I?" for the singular
of affirmation, "I have not, have I not?, why have I not?"
for the singular of negation, and so on with other persons and
the corresponding plural forms. He further counsels the
student to practise 108 similar variations in the same tense,
by means of the use of the pronouns <i>me</i>, <i>te</i>, <i>se</i>; "for the first
person, I have me, I have thee, I have him, and we turn it,
we shall have, Have I me, have I thee, have I him. Then
putting why before it we shall have, Why have I me," etc.,
and so on, on lines exactly similar to the example for thirty-six
variations. Apparently such exercises were the mainstay of
his grammatical instruction, for rules of grammar are reduced
to a minimum. Practice held a higher place than theory in
Duwes's estimation, and his attitude towards attempts to
draw up rules for the French language was very sceptical;
to be complete, the numbers of such rules would be infinite,
and, what is more, rules are of more use to the teacher than
to the learner.</p>

<p>Palsgrave, on the contrary, had a firm belief in the value
and soundness of grammar rules. He seems to have been
the first to advocate the learning of French chiefly by
means of grammar. The earliest treatises had been intended
more to correct the French of those who read them than
to teach the language; and though in later times the rules
were intended to impart a knowledge of the language,
they were not put in the first place, and it was always
felt that they were very secondary to "custom and the
use of reading and speaking." Before Palsgrave's grammar
appeared, declares his enthusiastic pupil Andrew Baynton,
Englishmen did in a manner despair of learning French except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">-92-</a></span>by an "importune and long continued exercise and that
begun in young and tender age." Sir Thomas Elyot in <i>The
Boke of the Governour</i>, which appeared a year after Palsgrave's
grammar, seems to regret this interference with long-standing
custom, by means of which French was "brought into as
many rules and figures and as long a grammar as is Latin
or Greek."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> He was afraid that the "sparkes of fervent
desire of learnynge" should be "extincte with the burdone
of grammar, lyke as a lytell fyre is sone quenched with a
great heape of small stickes: so that it can never come to
the principale logges where it shuld longe bourne in a great
pleasaunt fire." Many years elapsed, however, before the
deadening effect of too much grammar, apprehended by
Elyot, was felt in the teaching of French.</p>

<p>Palsgrave's method of teaching, therefore, was the reverse
of that of his fellow-worker, although he professes a desire
to induce his pupils not only to love their studies, but to be
merry over them.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> It appears that he was fond of making
his pupils learn rules by heart,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> while the dynamic of
his method was translation from English into French&mdash;an
exercise not very popular amongst teachers at this time. So
great was his faith in his rules that he felt that the student
might, with their aid, even dispense with the assistance of a
teacher. By an attentive study of the first book the reader
"shal undouted attayne to the right and naturall pronunciation
of this sayde tonge." And he assures the student that
by reading the general information in the introduction to
his first two books, and by learning by heart the three perfect
verbs in his second book (<i>Je parle</i>, <i>Je convertis</i>, <i>Je fais</i>, representatives
of the three conjugations into which Palsgrave
arranges French verbs) and the three irregulars (<i>J'ai</i>, <i>Je suis</i>,
and <i>Je m'en vais</i>), he will know French tolerably well, and
be able, with the help of the vocabulary in the third book, to
translate from English into French, and "so incontinente
accustome hym to have theyr common speache"; and, again
using the vocabulary, he will be able to read any French
author by his own study, without help or teacher, if he knows
the second book perfectly. However, he advises those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">-93-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">HIS DIALOGUES IN FRENCH AND ENGLISH</span>desire to attain perfection, or to qualify themselves for foreign
service, to read and study the whole of the three books.</p>

<p>Palsgrave seems to assign the priority to Duwes by mentioning
him as one of his immediate predecessors, although
Duwes's work was not published until after Palsgrave's.
Yet it is improbable that the debt on either side was
anything but trifling. Duwes had been teaching many
years before we first hear of Palsgrave. As he taught
he drew up grammatical rules for the use of his pupils; and
when he was tutor to the Princess Mary, she requested him
to collect together and publish the material he had used in
teaching the king, her father, as well as other members of
the royal family.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> According to Palsgrave, diverse noblemen
supported the princess's request. Thus most of the rules
published in Duwes's grammar had been composed very many
years before they were published, for Duwes had then been
teaching for over thirty years. And no doubt Palsgrave, who
was also employed at Court, had opportunities of seeing
them in manuscript. As to the dialogues and other practical
exercises, they were all specially written for the use of the
princess, and so are of later date than most of the rules.
Duwes had doubtless composed for the benefit of his earlier
pupils similar exercises, which remained in manuscript form
and were lost. Some idea of the dates at which the dialogues
were written and of the period during which Duwes was
engaged in teaching the princess may be gathered from
references to topical events which occur in the text. For
instance, mention is made of a peace newly proclaimed
throughout the kingdoms of France and England, which was,
no doubt, that of 1525, when England joined with France
to counteract the excessive power of Spain. We also find a
somewhat vague reference to a possible marriage for the
princess with a "king or emperor," and remember that it
was in 1525 that negotiations for her marriage with Charles V.
were broken off, and others for an alliance with the French
king, Francis I., begun. Another circumstance points to this
same period. One of the dialogues takes place at Tewkesbury
Park; it was in 1526 that Mary was created Princess
of Wales, and sent to Ludlow to hold her Court there, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">-94-</a></span>November of the same year six of her Council addressed a
letter to Wolsey from Tewkesbury. Duwes is not mentioned
by name in a list of the princess's household appointed on
this occasion, probably because he was already in her service;
and it is interesting to note that the Countess of Salisbury,
her lady governess, had instructions "without fatigacion or
weariness to intende to her learninge of Latine tongue and
French," as well as her music, dancing and diet.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In May
1527, Mary had returned to London, and took part in the
festivities given at Greenwich in honour of the French
ambassadors who had come to ask for her hand on behalf of
the French king's second son, Henry, Duke of Orleans. We
may therefore conclude that Duwes's grammar rules were
composed at various dates from the beginning of the
century, and the dialogues probably between the years
1524 and 1527.</p>

<p>Palsgrave, on the other hand, began his great work when
Henry VIII. appointed him French tutor to his sister Mary,
the future Queen of France, in 1512. He had "conceyved
some lyttle hope and confidence" by receiving such a noble
charge, and thought it a convenient occasion for showing his
gratitude by means of his works. Several years later he completed
"two sondrie bookes" on the subject, which he offered
in manuscript to his former pupil, the Dowager Queen of
France, and her husband the Duke of Suffolk. On their advice
and encouragement he undertook to enlarge these and to add a
third, and present the whole to the king. In 1523, Palsgrave
had planned the whole of the three books, for in that year he
made a contract with the printer, Richard Pynson, in which it
is stipulated that "the sayd Richarde, his executors and assignes
shall imprint or cause to be imprynted on boke callyd 'lez
lesclarcissement de la langue Françoys,' contayning iii sondrye
bokes, where in is shewyd howe the saide tong schould be
pronownsyd in reding and speking, and allso syche gramaticall
rules as concerne the perfection of the saide tong, with ii
vocabulistes, oone begynnyng with English nownes and verbes
expownded in frenshe, and a general vocabulist contayning all
the wordes off the frenshe tong expound in Englishe." Pynson
undertook to begin at once and to print every whole working
day, at the rate of a sheet a day, interrupting the work for
nothing save a royal order. The third book was not fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">-95-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">POPULARITY OF DUWES</span>written when the first two passed into the hands of the printer,
as Palsgrave constantly refers in it to the mistakes made
already by the printer in his second book,&mdash;mistakes unavoidable
in so "newe and unaccustomed worke." He also seems
to have modified his plan for the vocabulary; in that which
actually appeared in the third book there is a separate English-French
dictionary for each part of speech&mdash;noun, adjective,
verb, adverb, conjunction, and interjection. In the meantime,
Pynson died, and the book was completed by John
Hawkins, this being the only known production of his
press. The two writers, then, were both engaged on their
work for a great many years. Duwes was the first in the
field, but he wrote with no view to publication, merely to
satisfy the needs of his pupils. Palsgrave, on the other hand,
from the very first intended to publish his work, and had
great ambitions. Although he no doubt saw some of Duwes's
manuscript, his debt was of the slightest character, if it
can be called a debt at all. The respective size of the two
volumes is enough to prove this.</p>

<p>Duwes's small treatise, however, seems to have enjoyed
a greater popularity than that of Palsgrave;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> the latter did
not reach a second edition, whereas the former went through
three in rapid succession. This was no doubt largely due to
its conciseness and practical nature, which would appeal to the
student, discouraged at the sight of Palsgrave's immense work.
The first edition (as far as is known) of Duwes's <i>Introductorie</i>
must have appeared at least three years after Palsgrave's
<i>Esclarcissement</i>. The first two editions, printed, one by
Thomas Godfray, and the other by Nicholas Bourman for John
Reyns at the sign of the George in Paul's Churchyard, were
published during the years when Anne Boleyn was queen,
and after the birth of the Princess Elizabeth, as they both
contain a "laude and prayse" of the King, Queen Anne, and
her daughter. This leaves a period of under three years for the
publication of the two editions, seeing that Elizabeth was born in
September 1533, and Anne was put to death on the 19th of May
1536, Jane Seymour becoming queen in her stead on the 20th.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">-96-</a></span>The third edition<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> appeared after Duwes's death in 1535, as
perhaps the second edition may have done also. The dedication
to Anne is omitted, and a new one inserted, addressed to Henry
alone. The second part is here said to be "newly corrected and
amended"; but it is difficult to find in what the corrections
consist, for, with the exception of slight variations of spelling,
the edition is identical with the two earlier ones. It was
issued from the press of John Waley, who began to practise
his trade as printer in about the year 1546.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Most probably,
then, this edition appeared in the last months of the reign
of Henry VIII. (1547), and was one of the earliest works
issued from Waley's press. It is hardly likely that he would
have inserted the "laude and prayse" of the king if the work
had appeared after his Majesty's death.</p>

<p>Several reasons combine to explain how it was that Palsgrave's
work does not appear to have been as widely used as
that of Duwes.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> While his book was still in the press, alarming
rumours as to its size began to circulate, and caused the great
demand there had been for the work previously to diminish
noticeably. Some of Palsgrave's pupils made efforts to stop
the report, one of whom was Andrew Baynton, already
mentioned, a favourite courtier of Henry VIII. and vice-chamberlain
to three of his queens. "The labour needed to
master the book is not in proportion to his size!" he wrote
indignantly to three distinguished fellow-students, who helped
him to contradict the rumour. On the contrary, he argues,
it may rather be thought too small; it is as complete as
can be expected when we consider that it is the first of its
kind: clerks have laboured for years at Latin grammar and
still find something new; French grammar, then, cannot be
expected to attain completeness in this first attempt. But
"he that will seek, may find and in a brief time attain to his
utterest desire." Palsgrave deemed it wise to publish this
letter as a prefatory notice to his grammar; it may, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">-97-</a></span>have been written in the first place with that object in view.
<span class="sidenote">SALE OF PALSGRAVE'S GRAMMAR</span>He also judged it expedient to explain how students, not
wishing to study the whole, might learn enough French to
serve their purpose by selecting and learning certain sections
of the grammar.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, Palsgrave himself restricted the sale of his book.
On account of "his great labours, the ample largeness of the
matter, and the great difficulty of the enterprise," as well as
its "great costs and charges" (for he had the work printed
at his own expense), he was anxious to keep his grammar for
himself, his friends, and his pupils, "lest his profit by teaching
the French tongue might be minished by the sale of the same
to such persons as besides him were disposed to study the
French tongue." His chief aim was to keep his book out of
the hands of rival teachers, who might use it for their own
ends. Yet this attitude conflicts strangely with Palsgrave's
generous declaration in his epistle to the king, expressing the
hope that by means of his poor labours on this occasion "the
frenche tongue may hereafter by others the more easely be
taught, and also be attayned unto by suche as for their tyme
therof shal be desyrous." Nor was this the only precaution
taken by Palsgrave to ensure safety and fair dealing for his
grammar. He obtained from Henry VIII., to whom he
dedicated the work, a privilege for seven years,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> the king
being greatly "moved and stirred by due consideration of
his said long time and great diligence about this good and
very necessary purpose employed." The fact that Palsgrave
altered his original contract with Pynson twice<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> shows how
careful he was in all his proceedings. He wished to be sure
of having complete control of the 750 copies which were
printed. He did not trust the "sayd Richarde" further
than he could help, and intended to see that Pynson "used
good faith" in his dealings with him. Pynson was to give
Palsgrave six copies to present to the king and his friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">-98-</a></span>The rest were to be left at Pynson's house, in a room of which
Palsgrave kept the key, and to be sold only to such as
Palsgrave desired. When Pynson had paid himself,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> the
remaining books were to be given to Palsgrave, either to take
away or leave, as he willed. A striking example of the
difficulty there was in obtaining Palsgrave's grammar is
illustrated by the case of Stephen Vaughan. Again and
again he begged Palsgrave to let him have a copy, but
Palsgrave would not grant this favour at any price; and it
is easy to form an idea, from Vaughan's persistence, of the
great value attached to the grammar among serious students;
so great and unparalleled a work was credited with almost
supernatural powers. Finally, in despair, Vaughan wrote to
his patron Cromwell, asking him to use his influence with the
French teacher in obtaining this "jewell."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Cromwell had
received one of Palsgrave's presentation copies, and, as a last
resort, Vaughan begs him to let him have this. It is to be
hoped that the young man succeeded in getting a copy. At
any rate he seems to have made good progress in the French
language.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising to find that the fashionable Court tutors
were personally acquainted with each other. Palsgrave seems
to have had a great respect for Duwes, and to have set a high
value on the opinions of "that singular clerk." He feels he
"cannot too much praise his judgment concerning the French
Tongue." And he quotes Duwes's authority on the subject of
mean verbs, a matter about which he had consulted him personally.
We thus see that Palsgrave probably was more indebted
to Duwes in this direct way, than by any help he received from
such manuscripts as came into his hands. "Maister Gyles,"
who was librarian to the king, also showed Palsgrave a very
old text of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> in the Guildhall, "to shewe
the difference betweene tholde Romant tong and the right
french tong." The <i>Roman de la Rose</i> was a text frequently
quoted by Palsgrave in support and illustration of
his rules.</p>

<p>Thus Palsgrave has nothing but praise for Duwes, and no
doubt Duwes took a friendly interest in his younger rival,
<span class="sidenote">DUWES ON ENGLISH TEACHERS OF FRENCH</span>though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">-99-</a></span>he could not bring himself to excuse what seemed to
him his presumption in attempting to write rules for a language
not his own. Like many Frenchmen of the time, Duwes
firmly believed that it was not possible to draw up anything
like infallible rules for the French language, and that Englishmen
should presume, not only to teach it, but to do this also,
appeared to him preposterous. Would it not seem strange,
he cries, to see a Frenchman endeavouring to teach the
Germans their own language? Why should it be considered
less strange for Englishmen to teach French and lay down
rules and principles for the French language, a thing very few
of those who have the language "by nature" are able to do?
That these presumptuous Englishmen may be well read, and
possess a good knowledge of French&mdash;"au moins pour non
estre natif du territoire et pais"&mdash;does not alter the case; for
Art, though it follow Nature closely, can never overtake her.
Duwes himself, he tells us, had been teaching his language for
over thirty years, he had searched and worked hard, but had
never been able to find these so-called infallible rules&mdash;for it is
not possible to do so. Yet there are Englishmen who claim to
have done this great thing, though they have been studying
French for but a short time. With Greek and Latin the
matter is different. The rules of these languages have grown
up through the ages, and are the common property of all
nations. This tirade against English writers on the French
language is evidently aimed at Palsgrave and his predecessors,
all those who since the beginning of Henry's "well-fortuned
reign of this thing had written"&mdash;but above all at Palsgrave
and his ambitious aspirations.</p>

<p>Duwes's half-ironical assumption of humility as to the
value of his own rules, although the fruit of over thirty years'
experience in teaching, is probably meant as a rebuke to
Palsgrave, who claimed to have "reduced the French tongue
under a rule and grammar certain," and to have laid down
"rules certain and precepts grammatical like as the other
three perfect tongues." And when Duwes expresses, time
after time, his intention of avoiding all prolixity and 'super-fluity'
of words, we are also led to think that he is perhaps
directing his remarks at Palsgrave's wordy rules and the
size of his work. Duwes may have been a little annoyed at
being anticipated in publication by his younger rival. But
it is still more likely he resented, as a Frenchman, that
the honour of having first produced a great work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">-100-</a></span>
the French language should be generally ascribed to an
Englishman.</p>

<p>For Palsgrave, with very natural and just pride, laid claim
to this honour, and was supported by his contemporaries.
Andrew Baynton, in the letter already mentioned, speaks
of his "master" as being "the first author of our nation or
of the french mennes selfe that hath so farre waded in all
maner thinges necessary to reduce that tong under rules
certayne." The French, it is true, were beginning to take
some interest in their own language, and a French writer of
the time, Geoffrey Tory of Bourges, had urged the necessity
of reducing the French language to rules in his <i>Champ
fleury</i> (1529). "Would to God," he cried, "that some noble
soul would busy himself in drawing up and writing rules for
our French tongue!"<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Palsgrave was acquainted with Tory's
work, and thought he had realized Tory's ideal and "done
the thynge which by the testimony of the excellent clerke,
maister Geffroy Tory de Bourges (a late writer of the French
nation) in his boke entituled <i>Champ fleury</i>, was never yet
amongst them of that contraes self hetherto so moche as ones
effectually attempted." Leonard Coxe, the Principal of
Reading College, a popular philological writer of the time,
also connects the names of Tory and Palsgrave in some Latin
verses that were printed at the beginning of the grammar.
The short interval which elapsed between the appearance of
the two volumes renders it impossible for Palsgrave to have
got his first suggestion from Tory, and makes it very improbable
that Tory had even the smallest influence on his
work.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Tory had begun his work in 1522. Before this date
Palsgrave had already completed two books of his Grammar.
He notes, however, as a coincidence, that Tory and himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">-101-</a></span>quote the same French authors.
<span class="sidenote">PUPILS OF DUWES</span>Throughout his Grammar,
Palsgrave continually alludes to the authority of French
authors, for he studied French a great deal in books. It
would not indeed have been possible to produce so comprehensive
a work in England without constant reference to
French writers, who, owing to the spread of printing, were
becoming more and more accessible. Palsgrave refers most
frequently to Alain Chartier and Jean Lemaire de Belges,
while Guillaume de Lorris (<i>Roman de la Rose</i>), Octovian de
St. Gelais, Jean Meschinot, Guillaume Alexis, and Froissart are
all consulted and quoted&mdash;a list in which, it will be noticed, the
name of no contemporary French poet figures. Palsgrave
was not content with simply referring to his authorities; he
sought to awake an interest in French literature by quoting
selections in verse and prose, with guides for pronunciation.</p>

<p>Apparently Duwes's attack on Palsgrave was only one of
many. Much before this Palsgrave had complained of
unreasonable opposition from his contemporaries, and the
"unpleasantness" to which he had to submit. One should
not, however, attach too much importance to such complaints,
for they seem to have been more or less habitual among writers
of the day. Duwes appears to have suffered in a similar way,
judging by the acrostic which closes his first book, and contains
an unusually vehement attack on the "correcteurs et de
toutes &#339;uvres repreveurs," those "grosses gens de rudes
affections, ivrognes bannis de vray sentement." It is hard
to imagine whence came such severe criticism; probably
from other French teachers, but most certainly not from
Court circles, where both these teachers enjoyed the greatest
popularity.</p>

<p>Nearly all the members of the royal family for two generations
learnt French from Duwes. He counted among his
pupils Henry VIII. when prince, his elder brother Arthur,
his sister Margaret, who became Queen of Scotland, and his
daughter Mary, afterwards Queen of England, besides many
English noblemen. There is also evidence that Henry's
favourite sister Mary, afterwards Queen of France, learnt
the first principles of French from Duwes before she became
the pupil of Palsgrave. His favourite scholar, however,
appears to have been the Princess Mary, afterwards queen,
at whose request he published his observations on the French
language. When Duwes began to teach her he was an old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">-102-</a></span>man, and a little inclined to melancholy. He was beginning
to feel the effects of the English climate and complains
bitterly of his chief enemies, December and January:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span lang="fr">
<span class="i0">Par luy (Decembre) ay fait pleurs et soupirs mains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ja ne sera que ne m'en remembre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">luy et Janvier mont tollu ung membre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">qui me fera que tant que je vivray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">en grant doulleur doresavant iray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">pourquoy je crains qu'en grant melancolie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">en fin fauldra que j'en perde la vie.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Gout, his chief affliction, often nailed him to his chair, and
prevented him from attending his pupil&mdash;a greater sorrow,
he says, than to suffer sickness and danger. On one occasion
he was so ill that he feared he would not see the princess
again, and sent a letter, asking pardon if ever he had rebuked
her in his lessons. His whole consolation "lies in the hope
that Spring, seeing him in such a piteous state, will take pity
on him."</p>

<p>Mary seems to have returned fully the affection of her old
master. He was her almoner and treasurer, and she playfully
called him her "adopted husband." Duwes spent a great
deal of his time with his pupil, and his "adopted wife"
appears to have become impatient when his gout or any other
reason kept him from her. In one of the dialogues she is
shown rebuking him for his absence one evening:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mary.</i> Comment Giles, vous montrés bien qu'avés grant cure et soing
de m'aprendre quand vous vous absentés ainsy de moy.</p>

<p><i>Gyles.</i> Certes madame, il me semble que suis continuellement ici.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Voire, et ou estiés vous hier a soupper je vous prie.</p>

<p><i>Gyles.</i> Veritablement, madame, vous avez raison, car je m'entroubliay
ersoir a cause de compagnie et de communication.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Je vous prie, beau sire, faictes nous parçonniere de vostre communication,
car j'estime quelle estoit de quelque bon purpos.</p>

<p><i>Gyles.</i> Certes, madame, elle estoit de la paix, laquelle (come on disoit)
est proclamée par tout ce royaume. . . .</p></div>

<p class="noi">Then master and pupil are pictured discussing at length the
subject of peace. Love, the nature of the soul, and the meaning
of the celebration of Mass were other topics on which
they had long conversations; and they would accompany
their supper&mdash;for the princess begged her master to dine with
her as often as possible, in order to talk French&mdash;by discourse
on health and diet, in the course of which Duwes gave the
princess much friendly advice. His eloquence on the subject
<span class="sidenote">QUEEN MARY'S FRENCH STUDIES</span>suggests that when he calls himself a "doctor" he means a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">-103-</a></span>
doctor of medicine. Thus Mary's practice in the language
was not by any means limited to regular lessons, and these
lessons were always kept in close contact with her daily life.
She is taught how to receive a messenger from the king, her
father, or from any foreign potentate, in French, or how to
accept presents from noble friends. Duwes sometimes used
his lessons as a means of conveying to Mary messages from
different members of her household. Lady Maltravers exhorts
her to study French seriously that reports of her ability may
not be belied, and that she may be able to speak French with
the king her father, and her future husband, "whether king
or emperor"; and her carver, John ap Morgan, writes to her
when she is ill, to express his hopes for her speedy recovery.
When Duwes's gout prevented him from waiting on the
princess, he would send her a poem of his own composition,
in French with an interlinear English version&mdash;Duwes wrote
singularly crude and inharmonious verses&mdash;which the princess
learnt by heart by way of lesson. Or he would excuse his
absence in a letter, which, he assures her, "will not be of
small profit" to her if she learns it.</p>

<p>Such were the relations of Duwes with his favourite pupil.
Little else is known of his life beyond the fact that he taught
French for nearly forty years in the highest ranks of English
society. He himself tells us that he was a Frenchman, and
in all probability he was a native of Picardy, for his name is
of Picard origin, and there are a few traces of picardisms in
his work. We also know that he was librarian to both
Henry VII. and Henry VIII.,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and that in 1533 he was
appointed a gentleman waiter in the Princess Mary's household,
and his wife one of the ladies-in-waiting;<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> that,
curiously enough, he was a student of alchemy and wrote
a Latin dialogue, <i>Inter Naturam et Filium Philosophiae</i>,
dated from the library at Richmond (1521), and dedicated
to his friend "N. S. P. D.";<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> that he died in 1535, about
two years after the publication of his <i>Introductorie</i>; and that
he was buried in the Parish Church of St. Olave in Old Jury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">-104-</a></span>where he was inscribed as "servant to Henry VII. and
Henry VIII., clerke to their libraries, and schoolmaster of
the French Tongue to Prince Arthur, and to the Ladie
Mary"&mdash;a by no means complete list of his illustrious
pupils.</p>

<p>Among Duwes's earliest pupils had been Henry's sister
Mary, afterwards Queen of France. This princess, however,
was to continue her study of the language under John Palsgrave,
and the first we hear of Palsgrave as a teacher of French is
on the occasion of his appointment by Henry VIII. as tutor to
his sister, probably towards the end of 1512, when negotiations
for the princess's marriage with the Prince of Castile, afterwards
Charles V., were in progress.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> And when at last it fell
to the lot of the princess to marry, not the emperor, but the
French king, Louis XII., in 1514, Palsgrave remained in her
service, and accompanied her to France in the capacity of
almoner. Like the majority of her English followers, he was
soon dismissed from her service. Yet Mary did not forget
her former tutor. From time to time she wrote to Wolsey,
seeking to obtain preferment for him;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> like many other
men of his standing, Palsgrave was in Holy Orders, and
became later chaplain to the king. In November 1514
the Queen of France wrote to Wolsey to beg his favour
on behalf of Palsgrave that he may continue at "school."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
From this we may conclude that Palsgrave was continuing
the studies he had begun at an earlier date at the University
of Paris. He calls himself "gradué de Paris" in
1530, and no doubt also, his work on the French language
was making headway.</p>

<p>How long he remained in France is uncertain, but we
are told that on his return he was in great demand as a
teacher of French and Latin to the young English nobility
and gentry.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Sir Thomas More, writing to Erasmus in 1617,
mentions that Palsgrave is about to go to Louvain to study
there. This second sojourn at a foreign university was not of
long duration, for Erasmus, in a letter dated July the same
year, informs Tunstall that Palsgrave had started for England.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
Palsgrave was soon to receive from the king a second important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">-105-</a></span>appointment as tutor.
<span class="sidenote">PALSGRAVE'S PUPILS</span>On the formation of the household of
his natural son, Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond, in 1525,
when his "worldly jewel," as Henry called the young duke,
was made Lieutenant-General of the North, the king entrusted
Palsgrave with the charge of bringing him up "in virtue &amp;
learning."<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Palsgrave was allowed three servants and an
annual stipend of £13:6:8. He took great pains with his
young pupil's education, and the king seems to have approved
of his method.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Such was not the case with Gregory Cromwell,
who, it appears, shared the lessons of the duke. When
Gregory went to Cambridge under John Cheking's care, the
latter wrote to Cromwell that he had to unteach his charge
all he had learnt, and that if such be Palsgrave's style of
teaching, he does not think he will ever make a scholar.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
Palsgrave declares that he suffered much, when in the North,
from poverty and calumny.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> His friend, Sir Thomas More,
lent him money, and Palsgrave begged him to continue to
help him to "tread underfoot" that horrible monster poverty.
He also petitions his constant patroness the Dowager Queen
of France and her husband the Duke of Suffolk. All he has
to live by and pay his debts and maintain his poor mother is
little more than £50.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Among Palsgrave's other pupils of note were Thomas
Howard, brother to the Earl of Surrey; my Lord Gerald,
probably the brother of the fair Geraldine, the object of Lord
Surrey's passionate sonnets; Charles Blount, son and heir
of Lord Montjoie; Thomas Arundel, who later lost his head
for conspiring with the Duke of Somerset against Northumberland,
and Andrew Baynton, who has been mentioned already:
all students of French, who were acquainted with his book
before it was published, and knew his "hole intente and consyderation
therein," and who called Palsgrave "our mayster"
with a certain amount of pride.</p>

<p>The year after the publication of his grammar, Palsgrave
went to Oxford, where he was incorporated M.A. and took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">-106-</a></span>the degree of B.D.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> He was, however, back in London in
the following year, taking pupils into his house and visiting
others daily. He had, for instance, promised to serve Mr.
Baynton and Mr. Dominico in the house of the latter till
Candlemas. Of the pupils who were "with him," the "best
sped child for his age" was William St. Loe, afterwards Sir
William and captain of Elizabeth's Guard. Palsgrave seems
to have suffered much from interruptions in his pupils' studies
caused by visits to their mothers, or by their leaving London on
account of the unhealthiness of the city. He writes to William
St. Loe's father that if he takes his son away for either of these
reasons the child will not "recover this three years what he
has lost in one," and moreover he will have "killed a schoolmaster,"
for Palsgrave vows he will never teach any more. He
also writes that after spending a little time at Cambridge,
where he could take the degree of D.D., he intends to keep
school in Black Friars, and have with him Mr. St. Loe's
son, Mr. Russell's son (who is a good example of what
results from interruption of studies by a visit home), the
younger brother of Mr. Andrew Baynton, and Mr. Norice's
son, of the Privy Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> At Cambridge, also, he would
be able to get an assistant, as at present the strenuous
and continuous application to teaching is ruining his health.
Nothing else is known of Palsgrave's teaching career. He
seems to have spent a good deal of time towards the end of
his life at one or other of the rectories<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> to which he was
collated by Archbishop Cranmer, and where, no doubt, he
continued to receive pupils till the time of his death in
1554.</p>

<p>Palsgrave's great French Grammar was not his only professional
work. He also published a text-book for the use of
students of Latin. This was a Latin comedy, Acolastus,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> which
had made its way into English schools. Palsgrave added an
English translation of his own, and the whole appeared in
1540, with a dedication to the king. He says it is a translation
according to the method of teaching Latin in grammar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">-107-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">EDWARD VI.'S FRENCH EXERCISES</span>schools, "first word for word, and then according to the
sense." Palsgrave had also announced his intention of
publishing a book of French proverbs; he had written in his
grammar: "There is no tongue more aboundante of adages
or darke sentences comprehendyng great wysdome. But of

Goddes grace to make of thes adages a booke aparte." There
is, however, nothing to show that he ever realized this intention,
even partially.</p>

<p>Another French teacher in the royal family was Jean
Bellemain, tutor to Edward VI. Edward refers to his French
master in the passage in his diary<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> in which he gives an account
of his education. Speaking of himself in the third person, he
writes: "He was brought up until he came to six years old
among the women. At the sixth year of his age he was
brought up in learning by master Dr. Cox, who was after his
almoner, and John Chepe, M.A., two well-learned men, who
sought to bring him up in learning of Tongues, of scripture,
philosophy and all liberal sciences: also John Belmaine,
French man, did teach him the French language." It appears
from a letter of Dr. Cox to Secretary Paget, that the prince
had his first lesson in French on October 1, 1546.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> His
teacher was a zealous Protestant, a friend and correspondent
of Calvin, and he had probably some influence on the religious
opinions of his pupil.</p>

<p>The three French exercises in the king's hand which are
still in existence show that he made rapid progress in the
language.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> They all bear on religious subjects, showing how
carefully Bellemain attracted the attention of his young pupil
to this matter. All were written after his accession to the
throne (1547), and were dedicated to his uncle, Protector
Somerset. The first two are very similar in composition.
Edward made a collection of texts out of the Bible in English,
bearing on two subjects, Idolatry and Faith. He then
proceeded to turn these from English into French as an
exercise in translation. After they had been corrected by
his master, the king had them transcribed into a paper book&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-108-</a></span>first consisting of twenty pages, the second of thirty-five&mdash;and
sent them to the Protector.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The first was written
when Edward had been learning French for about a year (in
1547), and the second shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The third exercise is much longer than the two earlier
ones, and differs from them in being not a translation, but
a composition of Edward's own in French. It is entitled,
<i>A l'encontre des abus du Monde</i>, and was begun on December 13,
1548, and finished on March 14 of the following year, so that
its composition occupied Edward for over three months.
The manuscript is corrected throughout by Bellemain, who
makes the interesting entry at the end, that the young king,
who was then not yet twelve, had written the whole without
the help of any living person. Bellemain seems to have been
very proud of his pupil's performance; he sent a copy of
it to Calvin as "flowers whose fruit would be seen in due
season."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Calvin in turn sent Bellemain observations on
the composition for him to transmit to his pupil, and advised
its publication, which Edward would not hear of.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Bellemain
remarks that Edward took great delight in Calvin's
works, and from time to time the French tutor acted as a
medium of communication between the two, as in the case
just mentioned. Calvin did not scruple to give the young
monarch advice on religious subjects,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> while Cranmer invited
him to write to the young king. Bellemain himself made
a translation of the English Liturgy of 1552, and sent it to
Calvin to have his opinion on it.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Besides these three exercises, two of Edward's French
letters have also survived. One is addressed to Queen
Katharine Parr and the other to the Princess Elizabeth. In
the former he compliments the queen, whom he more usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">-109-</a></span>addressed
<span class="sidenote">JEAN BELLEMAIN</span>
in Latin, on her beautiful handwriting.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
The other
is to Elizabeth, who, it appears, had written to him in French,
inviting him to reply in the same language. He takes her
advice:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Puisque vous a pleu me rescrire, tres chere et bien aymée s&#339;ur, je vous
mercie de bien bon cuer, et non seullement de vostre lettre, mais aussy de
vostre bonne exhortation et example, laquelle, ainsy que j'espere, me
servira d'esperon pour vous suivre en apprenant. Priant Dieu vous avoir

1548.&mdash;Vostre frere,</p>

<p class="signature">

</p></div>

<p class="noi">We see from the date of this letter that Edward had been
learning French nearly three months when it was written.</p>

<p>Bellemain's salary as French tutor to the king was £6:12:4
per quarter. In 1546 he received an annuity of fifty marks
for life; in 1550 a lease for twenty-one years of the parsonages
of Minehead and Cotcombe, county Somerset; in 1553 a
lease of the manor of Winchfield in Hampshire;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and in 1551
a grant of letters of denization.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> He stayed in England until
the king's death in 1553, and was present at his funeral.
No doubt, with his religious sympathies, he would find the
England of Mary's time an uncongenial home, and leave it
at as early a date as possible.</p>

<p>Bellemain did not compose any treatise on the French
language. He says that he had long nourished the hope of
writing some rules for French pronunciation and orthography;
but he changed his mind, thinking it mere folly to attempt to
give rules for that which was not yet fixed and certain. In a
translation into French of the Greek Epistle of Basil the
Great to St. Gregory upon solitary life, which he dedicated
to the Princess Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> he expresses his opinion upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">-110-</a></span>new style of French orthography, then promoted by certain
writers, with whom he did not agree on most points. These
writers<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> wished to make the orthography tally with the
pronunciation and to discard the letters which are not pronounced;
they would thus change the spelling still used for
the most part by scholars and courtiers, and which in Bellemain's
opinion is preferable to that proposed by the so-called
reformers. He argues that an alteration of the spelling of
French would necessitate a corresponding change in Latin,
where the letters have the same sound and meaning, a thing
which appears ridiculous to the merest observer. Besides,
the derivative consonants are useful, as they serve to distinguish
words of identical sound but different meaning and
derivation, and to indicate the length of the preceding vowel.
On the other hand, letters have been added by versifiers
merely to suit their rimes, and these writers have done more
than any others to corrupt French orthography. Of what
avail is it, asks Bellemain, to compose rules on a subject so
much in dispute? For these reasons he abstained from
increasing the number of works on the French language
produced in England.</p>

<p>In the dedication to Elizabeth of his translation of Basil
the Great's Epistle to St. Gregory, Bellemain shows that
he was familiar with the books which the princess read, and
also expresses his desire that she will not let her French be
corrupted by the so-called reformed orthography she may
meet in some of these books.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Thus Bellemain took an interest
in Elizabeth's French, and it is highly probable that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">-111-</a></span>her tutor in that language.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
<span class="sidenote">QUEEN ELIZABETH'S KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH</span>In the year 1546, when he
began to teach Edward French, the Princess Elizabeth shared
for some time her brother's studies. It is said that they
began with religious instruction in the morning, and the rest
of the forenoon, breakfast alone excepted, was devoted to
the languages, science, and moral learning. Edward then
went to his outdoor exercises and Elizabeth to her lute or
viol.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> No doubt, then, she received lessons from the French
tutor until she left her brother in December. Elizabeth,
however, had made considerable progress in the language
some years before this date, and before 1544, so that it is
extremely likely that Bellemain had been teaching her for
several years before he was appointed French tutor to Edward,
perhaps owing to his success with Elizabeth. At any rate there
does not seem to be any trace of any other French tutor to
the princess, and the fact that he received an annuity of £50
for life suggests that he had already rendered some service in
the royal family.</p>

<p>The scholar Leland praised Elizabeth's skill in French and
Latin when he saw her at Ampthill with her brother, and
already in 1544 she had completed the first composition in
which she exerted her early activity in the French language.
This was a translation of Margaret of Navarre's <i>Miroir de
l'ame pecheresse</i>,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> which she called <i>The Miroir or Glasse of the
Synneful Soul</i>, and dedicated to Queen Katharine Parr.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> It
was published in 1564 under the title, <i>A godly meditacyon of
the Christian soule concerning a love towards God and Hys
Christe, compyled in Frenche by Lady Margarete, Quene of
Naver, and aptly translated into Englysh by the right vertuous
lady Elizabeth, daughter of our late Soverayne Kynge Henri the
VIII.</i><a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The translation itself is not very good, and the style
is awkward. But Elizabeth was only eleven years old when
she undertook it, and observes apologetically that she "joyned
the sentences together as well as the capacite of (her) symple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">-112-</a></span>witte and small lerning coulde expende themselves." In the
following year (1545) she translated some prayers and meditations
written in English by the queen, Katharine Parr, into
Latin, French, and Italian, and dedicated them to her father.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
Of greater interest is a little book the princess wrote in
French, and also offered to the king&mdash;a translation into
French of the <i>Dialogus Fidei</i> of Erasmus, thus inscribed:
"A Treshaut Trespuissant et Redoubté Prince Henry VIII
de ce nom, Roy d'Angleterre, de France et d'Irlande,
défenseur de la foy, Elizabeth sa Treshumble fille rend
salut et obedience." This treatise, composed before the
death of the king in 1547,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> was preserved in the Library at
Whitehall, and often attracted the attention of foreign visitors
in London.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Thus Elizabeth was well accomplished in French before
the reign of Edward VI. It was while her brother was king
that the great Hebrew scholar, Antony Rudolph Chevallier,
commonly called Monsieur Antony, was for a short time
her tutor in French. Chevallier was a Norman who had
studied Hebrew under Vatable at Paris, and had been forced
to take refuge in England on account of his religious opinions.
He studied at Cambridge and lived for a year in the house of
Archbishop Cranmer,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> who brought him to the notice of the
young king (then famous for his patronage of foreign scholars
of the Reform) and of Protector Somerset, who appointed him
tutor to the Princess Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>On the death of Edward VI., Chevallier, like Bellemain,
left England. He taught Hebrew at Strasburg and Geneva,
where he came into contact with English student refugees
under the reign of Mary I., and made the acquaintance of
Calvin. He returned to England in the reign of Elizabeth
(1568) to solicit the queen's help for the French Protestants.
He received a good welcome, and in 1569 was made a lecturer
in Hebrew at Cambridge, where "he was accounted second
to none in the realme." He returned to France before the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew (1570), and died as a result of
the hardships he suffered in making his escape.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS OF FRENCH TUTORS</span>It is a curious fact that the religious opinions of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">-113-</a></span>
tutors in Henry VIII.'s family were reflected in the reigns of
their pupils&mdash;the Protestant Edward VI., the Roman Catholic
Mary, and the Protestant Elizabeth. Both Duwes and
Bellemain allowed the subject of religion to make its way
into their lessons, and they probably exercised some
influence, differing in degree, on the religious convictions of
their pupils.</p>

to the throne in 1509; 9 + 22 = 31. This leaves Palsgrave a longer period to gather
what he could from Tory's work, says Génin. But the twenty-second year of the
reign of Henry VIII. began in April 1530, and the printing of Palsgrave's work was
completed on the 18th of July.</p></div>

sought to make orthography tally with pronunciation (in his <i>Traité touchant le comun

by Peletier du Mans (<i>Dialogue de l'ortografe et prononciation françoese</i>, 1549) and others,
and bitterly attacked by the opposing party. The question, once opened, continued
to be discussed until the decision of the Academy (founded 1649) settled the matter.

<h3>THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGIOUS REFUGEES ON THE TEACHING OF
FRENCH IN ENGLAND&mdash;OPENINGS FOR THEM AS TEACHERS&mdash;DEMAND
FOR TEXT-BOOKS&mdash;FRENCH SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND
AND SCOTLAND</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Religion</span>, the question of all questions in the sixteenth
century, was destined, incidentally, to exercise a great influence
on the teaching of French in England. The conflicts resulting
from the fierce hatreds aroused by the Reformation compelled
many Protestants to seek asylum from the triumphant
Catholic reaction abroad, and England was the land to which
many of them fled.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Among these refugees were many
who took upon themselves the task of teaching their native
tongue to the English. The second half of the sixteenth
century was the time when this influence was most strongly
felt, although it is not altogether negligible in the years
immediately preceding. In France the Reformation had at
first been favourably received at Court, but in the third
decade of the century persecution began to drive some Protestants
from their native land. They made their way to
England with some trepidation at this early date,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> for Henry
VIII., in spite of his breach with Rome, had but little sympathy
with the Protestants, although he refused on several occasions
to surrender fugitive heretics to the French king.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> On the
accession of Edward VI. in 1547, however, England became
<span class="sidenote">FOREIGNERS IN ENGLAND</span>a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">-115-</a></span>hospitable abode for the Protestants, driven from
France in increasing numbers by the persecutions sanctioned by
Henry II., whose reign coincided with that of Edward. When
Mary came to the throne all protection extended to these
fugitives was withdrawn, and we find many of their protectors
fleeing in their turn "to the Church and Christian congregation,
then dispersed in foreine realmes, as to the safest bay."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The return of the English Government to Protestantism in
the reign of Elizabeth coincided with the period of increased
persecution on the Continent. Refugees arrived in great
numbers, not only Huguenots from France, but also subjects
of Philip II., Dutch, Flemings, and Walloons, fleeing from the
cruelties of Alva.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> These inhabitants of the Low Countries
came to England in greater numbers than the Huguenots.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
Many of them, such as the Walloons and Burgundians, spoke
French; and, while the chief teachers of the time were drawn
from the Huguenots, a large group of these French-speaking
Netherlanders also joined the profession. To these two classes
of French teachers must be added a third, the Roman Catholics,
who formed the largest proportion of the foreigners in England.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The number of foreigners, augmented by the arrival of
the refugee Dutch and French, created a situation which
required serious consideration. These foreigners now formed
a large fraction of the general population&mdash;probably about
one in twenty of the inhabitants of London.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> It became
indispensable to keep some record of them, especially as there
was a danger that spies and Roman Catholic emissaries might
enter the country under the guise of refugees, and the overcrowding
resulting from the arrival of so many aliens was
becoming a serious matter. In earlier reigns the names of
strangers in London had been registered; but in the time of
Elizabeth a census, both numerical and religious, was taken
more systematically, and at more and more frequent intervals.
In these returns of aliens dwelling in London,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> the names of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">-116-</a></span>many French teachers are preserved. Frequently their profession
is stated, and we are told what church they attended
and whether or not they were denizens, as well as the part of
London in which they dwelt, and, in the lay subsidies, the
amount they had to pay towards the heavy taxes levied on
strangers.</p>

<p>Other names are preserved in the lists of the grants of
letters of denization.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> This grant made the precarious
position of foreigners in England more secure. Denization
became almost indispensable to any one wishing to exercise
a craft or trade. These letters gave the recipient much the
same privileges as a native, except that he was still subject
to special taxation.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Only those intending to settle in England
would trouble to take out letters of denization; and that
many of these foreigners' stay in England was only temporary
is shown by the fact that, when the number of strangers was
greatest, as after the St. Bartholomew massacre, there is no
marked increase in the number of denizations granted.</p>

<p>Means for registering the Protestant section of the community
of foreigners were provided through the Dutch and
French churches in London.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> In 1550, Edward VI. had
granted the dissolved monastery of the Austin Friars to the
foreigners as a place of worship; some months later, owing to
their increase in numbers, they were allowed the use of another
building&mdash;St. Antony's Hospital in Threadneedle Street. The
congregation was divided, the Dutch part remaining in the
original church, while the French and the Walloons and other
French-speaking refugees moved to Threadneedle Street.
Both churches, each with two pastors,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> were under the control
of a Superintendent. But when, in the time of Elizabeth,
the churches rose to new life, after their suppression in the
reign of Mary, the Superintendent was replaced by the
Archbishop of Canterbury. This change, however, did not
<span class="sidenote">RECEPTION OF REFUGEES IN ENGLAND</span>prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">-117-</a></span>the refugee congregations from enjoying many of their
former liberties, for in the time of Elizabeth the Archbishops,
who had themselves experienced the hardships of exile in the
reign of Mary, took a particular interest in the cause of the
refugees. The English, indeed, complained, not entirely without
reason, that the foreigners were allowed greater religious
freedom than they themselves.</p>

<p>As French and Dutch refugees settled in different parts
of the country, similar churches arose in these settlements.
By the end of the reign of Elizabeth there were French-Walloon
churches in existence at Canterbury, Glastonbury,
Sandwich, Southampton, Rye, and Norwich. In 1552 all
strangers were ordered to repair either to their own church
or to the English parish church. These injunctions were
renewed in the time of Elizabeth and became a useful means
of checking the number of refugees in London. From time to
time, during this reign, the Archbishop requested the ministers
of the foreign churches to send him a list of their communicants.
Foreigners who did not attend any church were not allowed
to apply for the privilege of letters of denization.</p>

<p>Thus the aliens who arrived in England in such large
numbers in the second part of the sixteenth century had
many restrictions placed upon them, especially if they were
engaged in any craft or trade which might arouse the
commercial jealousy of the English. In the teaching profession
such rivalry would not be felt to the same extent,
though it did actually exist. In any circumstance, however,
all the exiles had to endure the hatred and insults
of the common people, from which, nearly two centuries
later, Voltaire only escaped without injury thanks to his
ready wit. Riots such as those of Evil May Day (1517)
were directed mainly against foreign traders, but all foreigners,
especially Frenchmen, were a continual butt for the insults
of the mob. Nicander Nucius remarks that the common
people in England do not entertain one kindly sentiment
towards the French. "Ennemis du françois" is one of the
epithets applied to the English by De la Porte in his collection
of epithets (Paris, 1571) on the different nations. The
French priest, Étienne Perlin, who was in England during
the last two years of the reign of Edward VI., and thoroughly
hated the country, calling it "la peste d'un pays et ruine,"
speaks bitterly of the contrast between the courteous reception
the English receive in France, and the greeting of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">-118-</a></span>
in England with the cry, "French dogue": "it pleaseth
me not that these churls being in their own country spit in
our faces, and they being in France are treated with honour,
as if they were little gods."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> All foreign visitors to England
are at one in their complaints of the lack of courtesy among
the people. The great scholar Casaubon says he was more
insulted in London than he ever was in Paris; stones were
thrown at his window day and night, and once he was wounded
in the street on his way to pay his respects at Court.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>All these visitors, nevertheless, recognize that the English
nobility and gentry and those in authority are "replete with
benevolence and good order," and as courteous and affable as
the people are uncivil.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> And thus we find foreigners, especially
refugees, welcomed to chairs at the English universities,
and foreign students having their fees refunded on showing
they had suffered "for religion," and receiving ecclesiastical
preferment.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Most of the chief families in the realm, we are
told, received refugees into their midst. Laurence Humphrey<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
exhorts these noble families to fulfil the sacred duty of
hospitality towards strangers, especially religious exiles, whose
sufferings many of them had themselves experienced in the
reign of Mary, and to provide them with necessary livings,
admit them to fellowships, and allow them yearly stipends.
"Which well I wot, the noblest Prince Edward of happy
memory most liberally did both in London and either university,
whom some Dukes, Nobles, and Bishops imitated, chiefly
the reverend Father and late Primate of England ... Thomas
Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury.... Amongst the Nobles
not the least praise earned Henry Gray, Marquis of Dorset,
and Duke of Suffolk now a noble citizen of Heaven, who
liberally relieved many learned exiles. The like may be
said of many others."</p>

<p>Cranmer had entertained at Lambeth Pierre Alexandre
and "diverse other pious Frenchmen," including Antony
<span class="sidenote">TUTORS IN PRIVATE FAMILIES</span>Rudolph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-119-</a></span>Chevallier, who was tutor to Elizabeth for a short
time. Matthew Parker, his successor to the see in the time
of Elizabeth, followed his example and declared it to be a
Christian duty to befriend "these gentle and profitable
strangers." Cecil, Walsingham, and other dignitaries of the
time also became their protectors, and, recognizing the
advantages, both intellectual and commercial, which accrued
to the country, sought by all means to ward off the hostile
measures demanded from time to time by the English
<i>bourgeoisie</i>.</p>

<p>One French teacher of the time, G. de la Mothe, says that
so great was the affection of the English nobility and gentry
for the French that few of them were without a Frenchman
in their houses. Thus Pierre Baro, a native of Étampes and
student of civil law who came to England at the time of the
St. Bartholomew massacre, was "kindly entertained in the
family of Lord Burghley, who admitted him to eat at his own
table." Subsequently he went to Trinity College, Cambridge,
and became Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at that
university on the recommendation of his patron, besides
being admitted to the degrees of Bachelor and Licentiate of
Civil Law, and Doctor of Divinity (1576).<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Lord Buckhurst
had for a time in his house Claude de Sainliens or Holyband,
the most popular French teacher of the time, and several
other strangers; while Sir Nicholas Throckmorton gave shelter
to two Burgundians, one Dutchman, and four Frenchmen,
"whose names cannot be learned."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>In many instances we know that these refugees taught
French when thus received into noble families, and it is
extremely probable that such was almost always the case,
for French was one of the chief studies of the higher classes of
society and held an important place in the courtly education
of the time. This partiality for the language was called
one of the rare vocations which distinguished the English
nobility. An idea of the intellectual accomplishments necessary
to a young gentleman of the time may be gathered from
the programme drawn up for Gregory, the son of Mr. Secretary
Cromwell;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> this comprises "French, Latin, writing, playing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">-120-</a></span>at weapons, casting of accounts, pastimes of instruments."
Wilson, the author of the earliest treatise on rhetoric in
English,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> varies this scheme slightly; he commends the gentleman
"for his skill in French, or Italian, or cosmography,
Laws, Histories of all countries, gifts of inditing, playing on
instruments, painting, and drawing." Lord Ossory, Duke of
Ormond, for example, rode very well, was a good tennis-player,
fencer, and dancer, understood music and played
well on the guitar and on the lute; French he spoke elegantly,
while he read Italian with ease&mdash;a careful and significant
distinction between the two languages&mdash;and, in addition, he
was a good historian and well versed in romances.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>Thus a place had to be assigned to French in the education
of gentlemen. Thomas Cranmer,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> for instance, wrote to
Cromwell in 1539, making suggestions for the establishment
of a College in the Cathedral Church at Canterbury, to provide
for the instruction of forty students "in the tongues, in
sciences, and in French"&mdash;a proposal which came to nothing,
but is none the less important, as being the first attempt to
reinstate French in an educational institution.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the long-standing custom among
gentlemen of sending their sons to the houses of noblemen for
education was still practised to some extent, and French was
taught in these little communities.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The usual subjects of
study were reading, probably writing, and languages, chiefly
Latin and French. Sir Thomas More and Roger Ascham
were both educated in this way. More, at the age of three,
was sent to the house of John Morton, the chancellor,
where he learnt French, Latin, Greek, and music. Ascham
spent his early years in the house of Sir Humphrey Wingfield,
who "ever loved and used to have many children in his
house."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Sir Henry Wotton was "pleased constantly to
breed up one or more hopeful youths which he picked out
of Eton School, and took into his own domestic care."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
It was also customary for young peers to become royal
wards. In 1561 Sir Nicholas Bacon devised a plan for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">-121-</a></span><span class="sidenote">FRENCH IN EDUCATION OF GENTRY</span>"bringing up in virtue and learning" which he submitted
to Cecil. According to these articles,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> the wards were to
attend divine service at six in the morning, then to study
Latin till eleven; nothing is said of breakfast, but an hour
is allowed for dinner; from noon till two o'clock they were
to be with the music master, from two to three with the
French master, and from three to five with the Latin and
Greek masters. The rest of the evening was devoted to
prayers, honest pastimes, and music under the direction of a
master. No doubt Cecil put this advice into practice. Some
years later, Sir Humphrey Gilbert drew up an admirable
scheme for the "erection of an Academy in London for the
education of her majesty's wards, and others, the youth of
Nobility and Gentlemen," which was laid before the queen,
probably in 1570. Although this scheme was never carried
out, it is of great interest as showing what were the subjects
most likely to be taught. Gilbert's plan is very extensive.
French, of course, is included in the curriculum&mdash;"also there
shall be one Teacher of the French tongue which shall be
yearly allowed for the same £26. Also he shall be allowed
one usher, of the yearly wage of £10." Gilbert urges also the
teaching of other modern languages&mdash;Italian, to which he
assigns about as large a place as to French, and Spanish and
High Dutch, to which less importance is attached.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>French, then, was a recognized part of the education of
the nobility and gentry. Italian, it will be noticed, was also
considered desirable, but chiefly for reading purposes.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> In
the Elizabethan era Italian literature had perhaps more influence
on English writers than that of France, although it
not infrequently reached England through a French medium.
But when the first enthusiasm of the early days of the
Renaissance had burnt itself out, Italian was not cultivated
generally, except by those specially interested in literature or
by those who had special reasons for learning it. Nor was
Spanish much studied, except for practical purposes and the
government services; Richard Perceval, for instance, put his
excellent knowledge of the language at the disposal of Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">-122-</a></span>Burghley for the purpose of deciphering the packets containing
the first intelligence of the Armada.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Neither language could
be a dangerous rival to French, which alone was studied
generally, and by ever-increasing numbers.</p>

<p>It was in private tuition that those Frenchmen desirous
of teaching their language, or driven to do so by stress of
circumstances, would find the readiest opening and the largest
demand for their services. Turning to the various registers
of aliens, the earliest notices we find of French tutors are in
the grant of letters of denization for the year 1544.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> In that
year one, John Verone, a French and Latin tutor to the
children of William Morris, a gentleman usher to the king,
received the grant, as did also a certain Honorie Ballier, a
Frenchman who had been ten years in England, and was
engaged in teaching his language to the children of the Lord
Admiral, Lord Lisle, Duke of Northumberland. Yet another
teacher received the same privilege in this year&mdash;John Veron,
one of the "eminentest preachers" of the time, and the
author of various religious controversial works. He gained
considerable preferment in the Anglican Church, and once
preached before the queen at the Cross in St. Paul's Churchyard,&mdash;"a
bold as well as an eloquent man," and a perfect
master of the English tongue.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> In the earlier part of his life
in England, where he arrived about 1536, Veron had been
engaged in teaching gentlemen's children; a task in which,
say his letters of denization (1544), he "doth yet continue
with intent ever so to persevere." Veron manifested his
interest in the teaching of Latin and French by publishing
a Latin, French, and English dictionary in 1552, the first
dictionary, published in England, in which a place is given
to French. It is based on the Latin-French Dictionary of
Robert Éstienne,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> with the addition of a column in English,
and entitled <i>Dictionariolum puerorum tribus linguis Latina,
Anglica, et Gallica conscriptum cui anglicam interpretionem
adjecit Joannes Veron</i>.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>The impetus imparted to the teaching of French by the
arrival of these large numbers of refugees naturally led to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">-123-</a></span>increased
<span class="sidenote">TEXT-BOOKS FOR TEACHING FRENCH</span>production of books for teaching the language.
Nearly all the grammars written in the second half of the
sixteenth century are the work of Frenchmen,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> the English,
after their first initiative, soon giving place to the French
writers on the language, although not without some protest.
Some of these teachers no doubt made use of one or other
of the grammars which had appeared in French; many of
them taught without any such help, and a few were able to
use one or other of the grammars which had already been published
in England, while yet others set to work to compile
text-books of their own. As many of them were, or had
been, employed in noblemen's houses, and had composed their
grammars from material used in teaching in these noble
families, it was easy for most of them to find patrons for their
works,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and thus secure a greater measure of success by
offering them to the public under the protection of some
well-known and powerful name, which would "shadow these
tender plants" from the "over violent rays of reproachful
censurings." To dedicate a grammar to some famous pupil,
with praise of his rare knowledge of French acquired by
means of its contents and the excellent method employed by
his tutor, the author, was a very good form of self-advertisement,
freely used by the French teachers of the time. Among
patrons of French grammars were Edward VI. and particularly
Elizabeth, who is, says one of these writers, "le vray port de
retraite et asyle asseuré de ceux qui, faisans profession de
l'Evangile, souffrent ores persecution soubs la Tyrannie de
l'Antichrist"; another adds that she has "des estrangers
les c&#339;urs a volonté." Lord Burghley, Sir Henry Wallop,
Sir Philip Wharton, and other influential men of the time also
figure among the patrons of French teachers.</p>

<p>These French grammars which appeared in the second
half of the sixteenth century are of a decidedly more popular
kind than those of Palsgrave and Duwes, and appeal to a
larger public. The earlier grammars were written for the
special use of royalty and the highest ranks of the nobility.
Barclay, however, differs from his rivals in having a wider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">-124-</a></span>aim; his grammar is intended for the "pleasure of all englysshe
men as well gentylmen marchauntes, as other common people
that are not expert in the sayd langage." Palsgrave also, by
way of epilogue, expresses the hope that the "nobility of the
realm and all other persons, of whatever state and condition
whatsoever, may in their tender age, by means of it the sooner
acquire a knowledge of French by their great pains and
study"; but it is clear that the size and price of his book,
not to mention the restrictions he placed on its sale, would
prevent it from fulfilling any such aim.</p>

<p>In this new series of French text-books there appeared
nothing which could compare in importance with the great
work of Palsgrave; they were all the hasty product of teachers,
and intended to meet a pressing practical demand. The authors
had not the time, even if they had had the ability, to produce
any comprehensive study of the language, and, consequently,
their works are of more value as showing how French was
taught in England, and its popularity here, than as a store
of philological material for the historical grammarian. Rules
of grammar are usually reduced to as small a compass as
possible; and the largest part of the volumes is occupied by
dialogues in French and English, which give lively and often
dramatic pictures of contemporary family life, and of the busy
London streets of the time. A place is also given to familiar
phrases, collections of proverbs, and golden sayings.</p>

<p>The public to which such text-books appealed was wider,
including merchants and commoners, as well as the
gentry. Nor was the demand for tutors in the language
confined to the higher classes. At this time the great middle
classes were rising to wealth and prominence, and demanding
a share in the intellectual distinctions of their social betters.
"As for gentlemen, they be made good cheap in England,"
writes Sir Thomas Smith,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> in reference to the democratic
movement. In this new class of Englishman, the teachers
of French recruited a large number of their pupils. And so
the French teacher who visited a clientèle of pupils became
a familiar figure in the London of the later sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The numerous French-speaking inhabitants of London,
occupied in various trades and crafts in the city, were, so to
speak, his unconscious collaborators, for the proportion of
such foreigners in London was large enough to have some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">-125-</a></span>influence on the spread of the knowledge of French. <span class="sidenote">SHAKESPEARE'S KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH</span>We have
an instance of this indirect influence in the case of Shakespeare.
From 1598 he lodged for about six years, and possibly
longer, in the house of a Huguenot, one Christopher Montjoy,
who lived in Silver Street, Cripplegate<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>&mdash;a well-to-do neighbourhood,
and the resort of many foreigners. Montjoy was
one of the French head-dressers who were in such demand at
that time. His wife, daughter, and also his apprentice,
Stephen Bellot, formed the rest of the household, with whom
Shakespeare seems to have lived on fairly intimate terms;
he acted as a mediator in arranging a marriage between
Montjoy's daughter and Bellot, and, some years later, was
drawn into a family quarrel concerning a dowry which Bellot
claimed and Montjoy refused to pay; in 1612 Bellot took
the matter into the Court of Requests, and Shakespeare
was one of the witnesses summoned. Finally the matter was
referred to the consistory of the French Church, which decided
in Bellot's favour.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> It was no doubt during his sojourn in the
house of this Huguenot family that he improved his knowledge
of French, of which he gives evidence in his works.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
The two plays in which he uses the language most freely&mdash;<i>Henry
V.</i> and <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>&mdash;were produced
during the early time of his residence with Montjoy, whose
name is given to a French Herald in <i>Henry V.</i> In <i>The Merry
Wives</i> the French physician, Doctor Caius, speaks a mixture
of broken English and French,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and in <i>Henry V.</i> French is
introduced freely into a number of the scenes,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> while one, in

<p>It is not surprising, remembering Shakespeare's friendship
with the Huguenots, to find him quoting from the Genevan
Bible in the same play.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> When he composed it, he must have
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH NEGLECTED IN GRAMMAR SCHOOLS</span>had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">-127-</a></span>strong inclination to write French, as he sometimes uses
the language rather inconsistently, making the Dauphin, for
instance, speak French one moment and English the next.</p>

<p>On the whole, Shakespeare's French seems to have been
fairly correct grammatically, if not quite idiomatic.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> It
contains just enough mistakes and anglicisms to make it
extremely unlikely that he received help from any Frenchman;
for example, we find the Princess Katharine of France saying,
"Je suis semblable <i>a les</i> anges." On other occasions, when
Englishmen are speaking, Shakespeare purposely makes
their French incorrect and clumsy. That he could read
French is shown by the fact that some of the originals on
which he based his plays were not translated into English.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
Moreover, he probably read Montaigne in the original, unless,
like Cornwallis, Florio allowed him to see his translation in
manuscript&mdash;a rather remote possibility, as the French
would be easier of access. No doubt many others besides
Shakespeare owed a good deal of their knowledge of French to
direct intercourse with Frenchmen, a means of improvement
strongly advocated by the professional teachers of the time.
"Get you acquainted with some Frenchman" is their cry.</p>

<p>In addition to the refugees, students or men belonging to
no particular craft or profession who took up the teaching
of their language on their arrival in England, there were also
professional schoolmasters&mdash;French, Flemish, and Walloon.
Many of the latter, we may surmise, were no doubt driven
from their country by the edict issued by Margaret, Duchess
of Parma, in 1567. One clause was particularly directed
against schoolmasters who might teach any error or false
doctrine. None of these teachers, however, would find any
opening in the grammar schools, which were then "little
nurseries of the Latin tongue." The memorizing of Latin
grammar, with the study of rhetoric in the Latin writers, both
in verse and prose, formed almost the whole of the curriculum.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
In the books on education of the time the study
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">-128-</a></span>of French was equally ignored. These works, however, are
mainly from the pen of pedants, and have but little bearing
on practical education.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> For them French was not a
'learned' tongue, in spite of the efforts of Palsgrave to
secure its recognition as such.</p>

<p>But it is not difficult to reconcile the general prevalence of
the study of French with its absence from the grammar
schools. At this time, and throughout the seventeenth
century, there was a great division between scholastic education
and social requirements.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The school and educational
writers, in refusing to recognize French, held aloof from the
social needs of the day: "non vitae sed scholae discimus";
and in retaining the cosmopolitan atmosphere of the Middle
Ages they ignored the new spirit of nationalism which called
modern languages into prominence. The school had little,
if any, effect in retarding the progress of French, which came
to be looked upon in the light of an 'extra,' to be studied
privately and with the help of tutors. Many scholars of the
public or grammar schools had a private tutor who would
teach them French when occasion served. Such, for instance,
was the case with Sir Philip Sidney. Fulke Grenville and Sidney
both entered Shrewsbury School at the age of ten, in the year
1564. Two years later a letter of Sir Henry Sidney informs
us that he had received two letters from his son, one in Latin
and the other in French, "whiche I take in good parte, and
will you to exercise that Practice and Learning often: For
that will stand you in most steade, in that profession of lyf
that you are born to live in."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Apparently, then, Sidney
had received lessons in French either at home or out of school
hours. He had also, in all probability, had a French tutor
before he went to Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>French, however, was not entirely neglected in all schools.
As the grammar schools were "Latin" schools, there arose
in the second half of the sixteenth century a considerable
<span class="sidenote">PRIVATE FRENCH SCHOOLS</span>
number of private "French" schools, where this language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">-129-</a></span>
received special attention. The earliest of these owed their
origin to the refugees, both professional schoolmasters and
others. St. Paul's Churchyard, the busy centre of city life,
was the quarter round which many of these schools were
grouped. There they were most likely to get a good clientèle,
partly, it may be, among those boys attending St. Paul's
School who desired, like Sir Philip Sidney, to extend their
studies. In St. Paul's Churchyard, also, lived the chief
booksellers, who generally seem to have cultivated friendly
relations with French teachers, especially those whose books
they were commissioned to sell. Frequently they acted as
agents for the teachers, who in their grammars advise prospective
pupils to "inquire" at the bookseller's. And, at
this time, when indications of address were given by reference
to the nearest place of importance, printers' signs are frequently
used to locate the situation of French schools. At
least one of these schools seems to have been very well known,
for in 1590 the printer W. Wright, senior, gave as his address,
"neare to the French School."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>All of them, however, did not owe their origin to the French
refugees. We hear, for instance, of a certain John Love, an
Englishman, son of the steward of the Jesuit college founded
by the English Catholics at Douay, who had a French school
near St. Paul's, at the end of the century. But he was suspect,
as it was feared he might be an "intelligenceer."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Among
the earliest, however, if not the first of these French schools,
was that of Peter Du Ploich, a Frenchman, and no doubt a
refugee; at any rate the text-book for teaching French which
he published shows his strong sympathy with the Protestants.
This was entitled <i>A Treatise in English and Frenche right
necessary and profitable for al young children</i>, and was first issued
in about 1553 from the press of Richard Grafton, who had
"privilege de l'imprimer seul."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Of this schoolmaster's life little
is known.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> From his little French text-book, "right necessary
to come to the knowledge of the same," we learn that he kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">-130-</a></span>his school at the sign of the Rose in Trinity Street; that he
was married, and probably received some of his pupils into
his house; and that he taught French, Latin, and writing.
Probably religious instruction also formed part of the curriculum,
as it did in the other schools of the time; both
Henry VIII. and Edward VI. issued orders that the Paternoster,
the Ten Commandments, and the Apostles' Creed
should be taught to children.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Not only Du Ploich but
other French teachers of the time provided religious formularies
in their books for teaching the language, and in
1559-1560 the printer William Griffith received a licence to
print a Catechism in Latin, French, and English.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>The Catechism, Litany, Suffrages, and prayers occupy a
large part of Du Ploich's <i>Treatise</i>, which is of quarto size,
and consists of about fifty leaves.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> All these formularies are
given in both French and English, arranged in two columns
on each page.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Then come three familiar dialogues which
constitute the third, fourth, and fifth chapters of the book.
The first of these gives us a lively picture of family life at the
time. From the street, where we meet friends and are taught
how to greet and address them, we pass into the house, where
we are spectators of the family repast and of the arrival of the
guests, and hear conversation on many subjects in which
Du Ploich finds an opportunity for self-advertisement by
mentioning his school and address. A child reads a passage
from the New Testament, and the meal is preceded and
followed by lengthy thanksgivings, which, however, do not
interfere with the joviality and conviviality of the host.</p>

a number of his pupils. "L'aprentif" is the word he uses

<p>Du Ploich seems to have brought with him to England
a Genevan "A B C," or book of elementary instruction and
prayers for children, such as was common in France as well as
in England. The next section of his treatise treats of the
French A B C in words identical with those of an <i>A B C
françois</i> printed at Geneva in 1551. This is followed by a few
very slight rules in English, which tell us not to pronounce the
last letter of a French word, except <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>p</i>, when the next
word begins with a consonant; to neglect a vowel at the end of
a word when the following word begins with another vowel;
also that the accusative precedes the verb; that after <i>au</i>, <i>ou</i>, <i>i</i>,
and <i>eu</i>, <i>l</i> is not sounded; that the consonants <i>sp</i>, <i>st</i>, and
<i>ct</i> should not be separated in pronunciation; and that the
negative is formed by placing <i>ne</i> before the verb and <i>pas</i> or
<i>point</i> after it. To this scanty grammatical information, which
bears considerable resemblance to that contained in some
previous works,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> the eighth and last chapter adds the conjugation
of the two auxiliaries in Latin, English, and French.
The treatise closes with a Latin poem addressed to "preceptor
noster Du Ploich" by John Alexander, one of his pupils, and
with a table of contents.</p>

<p>No doubt French was the basis of the whole of the instruction
given by Du Ploich in his school. His pupils learnt to write
from this French text-book, and memorized the Latin verbs
with the French verbs. The fact that Du Ploich places his
few grammar rules at the end of the work, and after the
practical reading-exercises, shows what slight importance he
attached to them. He would, we may assume, refer his pupils
to them as occasion arose, but practical exercises and conversation
formed the chief part of his lessons. He made free
use of English in explaining the meaning of the French, and
throughout his book he sacrifices the English phrase in order
to render more closely the meaning of the French, for which
he duly apologizes: "that none blame or reprove this sayd
translacion thus made in Englishe because that it is a litle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">-133-</a></span>corrupt.
<span class="sidenote">DU PLOICH'S METHOD OF TEACHING</span>For the author hath done it for the better declaryng
of the diversitie of one tounge to the other, and it is turned
almost worde for worde and lyne for lyne, that it may be to
his young scholars more easy and lyght."</p>

<p>Du Ploich was thoughtful for his young pupils. "A
little at a time, and that done well" was his motto. On this
method, he says, the child will learn more in a week than he
would do in two months by attempting a great deal at the
beginning. The master should repeat the lesson two or three
times before allowing the child to say it, and be ready to
explain difficulties, and not wait for the child to guess. If
not, the pupil will lose patience and the little courage he
possesses. Du Ploich would have the verbs learnt on the
plan already advocated on a larger scale by Duwes, that is,
he advises the student to practise them negatively and interrogatively
as well as in the usual affirmative form.</p>

<p>Some time later, probably after Du Ploich's death, or
when he had left England, there appeared another edition of
his grammar. This was printed by John Kingston, and
finished on the fourteenth day of April 1578.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> An important
change in the arrangement of the chapters distinguishes it
from the edition of 1553; in the later edition the chapter on the
alphabet and grammar is placed at the beginning, although
in both issues the chapter on the two auxiliaries closes the work.
Kingston&mdash;for he was probably responsible for the change&mdash;thus
yielded to the tendency, which became stronger and
stronger as time advanced, of placing theoretical before
practical instruction. In addition to slight variations, other
differences between the two works are the omission of the
verses for "gens de finance," and of the Latin poem addressed
to Du Ploich by one of his pupils.</p>

<p><i>The Little Treatise in English and French</i> was not the only
work produced by Du Ploich during his residence in England.
On its completion he turned his attention to the composition
of a work on the estate of princes, which he called a <i>Petit
Recueil tresutile et tresnecessaire de l'Etat dez Princes, dez
Seigneurs temporelz et du commun peuple, faict par Pierre
Du Ploych</i>.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> This <i>Recueil</i> is written in French. Its subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">-134-</a></span>matter is not of much interest, but the Latin verses with
which it closes inform us that Du Ploich had a law degree
(Licentiatus Legum). He dedicated the manuscript, which
is not dated, to the "Roy tres puissant Eduard sixieme de ce
nom," who graciously received it and rewarded Du Ploich's
industry by a generous gift.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> This favourable reception encouraged
the French teacher to present another work to his
"Soverain lord and master" in the course of the following year.
This second manuscript is shorter than the earlier <i>Recueil</i>;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
it bears the title of <i>Petit Recueil des homaiges, honneurs et
recognoissances deubz par les hommes a Dieu le createur, avec
certaines prieres en la recognoissance de soy mesme</i>. At the end
occurs a passage of some interest in which Du Ploich expresses
his intention of providing the work, unworthy as it is, with an
English translation, as soon as he finds time and opportunity
for such an undertaking, for he has not English "de nature."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
This rendering, he says, will be "mot pour mot et ligne pour
ligne, affin d'augmenter les couraiges des professeurs." We
may infer from this that he thought of having the work
printed in French and English for the use of students.</p>

<p>A French school very similar to that of Du Ploich, but of
which we have more details, was kept by Claude de Sainliens,
De Sancto Vinculo, or, as he anglicized it, Holyband. A native
of Moulins and a Huguenot, Holyband probably sought refuge
in England from the persecutions. In 1571 he is said to have
been in England seven years;<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> hence he must have begun his
long career in London as a teacher of French in the year 1564.
In 1566 he took out letters of denization.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Holyband was
not exactly a scholar, but rather a man of broad interests,
sustained by extraordinary vitality, and before he had been in
England three years he had published two books for teaching
French, which became very popular, and continued to be
reprinted for nearly a century. There is no extant copy of
the earliest edition of the first of these, but it appeared most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">-135-</a></span>probably in 1565.
<span class="sidenote">CLAUDE HOLYBAND</span>The earliest copy known is dated 1573,
and bears the title, <i>The French Schoolemaister, wherin is most
plainlie shewed the true and most perfect way of pronouncinge
of the French Tongue</i>. The contents of this little book are
of the kind which became characteristic of works for teaching
French. It opens with rules for pronunciation and grammar
in English, of little value or originality, and purposely made
as concise as possible. These are followed by dialogues,
collections of proverbs, golden sayings, prayers, and graces
before meat, and a large vocabulary. The dialogues
are by far the most interesting portion of the work. Like
those of Du Ploich, they show a close connexion between
the teaching of French and the daily concerns of life. They
give us a picture of the busy London of the time, and especially
of St. Paul's Churchyard, as well as lively family scenes,
together with the usual wayside and tavern conversation.
We see the boy setting off to school in the morning, threading
his way through the busy streets, and again see him return
to the hearty and hospitable family dinner, during which he
finds occasion to speak of his French studies. These dialogues
are given in French and English arranged on opposite pages.
Their dramatic interest may be gathered from the opening
passage, where we listen to the servant hurrying the boy off
to school:</p>

<p>Whether Holyband had opened his French school or not
when he composed the <i>French Schoolemaister</i> is uncertain;
but the school was evidently in full swing at the time his
second work appeared, about a year later, in 1566. The
contents of the new work, <i>The French Littleton, a most easie,
perfect, and absolute way to learn the French tongue</i>, are much
the same as those of the <i>French Schoolemaister</i>. There is,
however, one important difference between the two works.
In the <i>Schoolemaister</i> the rules precede the practical exercises,
but this order is reversed in the <i>Littleton</i>. In the first
work Holyband does not appear to have fully evolved his
method of teaching French. By the time he wrote the
<i>French Littleton</i> he was able to lay down principles, based,
no doubt, on experience, and consequently he attached a
higher value to the second of his works, and used it himself
in teaching. The <i>French Schoolemaister</i> was intended more
for the use of private pupils. It was described as a "perfect
way" of learning French without any "helpe of Maister or
teacher,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> set foorthe for the furtherance of all those whiche
doo studie privately in their own study or houses." Holyband
himself does not seem to have given it much attention after
its first appearance. Nevertheless it enjoyed as great a popularity
and went through as many editions, or nearly so, as its
author's more favoured work. Other French teachers made up
for Holyband's neglect by editing it themselves in the early
seventeenth century. So great indeed was its success that
in 1600 a tax of 20 per cent was levied on each edition for the
benefit of the poor.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> We may perhaps conclude from this
that those who studied French privately were numerous.</p>

<p>The value of the <i>French Littleton</i> is more educational; it
expounds all the favourite theories of its author. The name
is taken from the popular work on English law, the text-book
for all law-students, Littleton's <i>Tenures</i>. While the <i>French
Schoolemaister</i> was a small octavo, the <i>Littleton</i> was printed to
the size of a tiny pocket-book, in 16mo. First come practical
<span class="sidenote">HOLYBAND'S FRENCH GRAMMARS</span>exercises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">-137-</a></span>in the form of dialogues in French and English,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> but
of less lively interest than those of the <i>Schoolemaister</i>. They
deal, however, with the same subjects,<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> only, as we read them
we do not forget, as we were inclined to do in the earlier book,
that we are reading exercises intended for school use. Then
follow proverbs, golden sayings, prayers, the creed, the fifth
chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, a treatise on the iniquity
of dancing (<i>Traité des Danses</i>), and finally a vocabulary less
comprehensive and of less value than that of the <i>French
Schoolemaister</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French Littleton</i> derives additional interest from the
fact that in it Holyband sets forth a new system for
rendering the pronunciation of French easier to the English.
He realized the difficulties placed in their way by the many
unsounded letters present in certain French words. He had
no desire, however, to join the extremists, who advocated the
omission of all such consonants in orthography as well as in
pronunciation. Holyband considered such letters an essential
part of the word, and often a useful indication of the pronunciation
of vowels and of the derivation. He therefore proposed a
compromise which he thought would please both parties: he
retains the unsounded letters, but distinguishes them from
those which were pronounced by placing a small cross below
them,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> a device adopted in later editions of the <i>French
Schoolemaister</i> also. A short quotation from the conversation for
travellers and merchants will show how Holyband applied

<p>The most interesting of the dialogues in the <i>French Littleton</i>,
however, is that in which we have a picture of Holyband's
school, which was first opened in St. Paul's Churchyard at
the sign of Lucrece&mdash;the shop of the printer Thomas Purfoote.
Here we see children arriving for their lessons early in the
morning, each with his own books and other materials. The
schoolroom seems to have been a lively place; the scholars
are represented as fighting, pulling each other's hair, tearing
their books, and indulging in other pranks of the kind.
Holyband sought to keep order by means of a birch, and
one of the many offences which called it into action was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">-139-</a></span>the speaking of English.
<span class="sidenote">HOLYBAND'S FRENCH SCHOOL</span>In this little school of his, Holyband
appears to have laboured at the task he set himself
of leading the English nation "comme par la main au
cabinet de (nostre) langue françoyse," under excellent conditions.
The whole atmosphere seems to have been French.
The curriculum, however, was not confined to this one
language. Holyband had to safeguard his interests by instructing
his pupils in the subjects taught in the ordinary English
schools, and so we find him teaching Latin, writing, and
counting, as well as French, and probably by means of French.
With some of his pupils Holyband studied Terence, Vergil,
Horace, the <i>Offices</i> of Cicero, and with others, Cato, the
<i>Pueriles Confabulatiunculae</i>, and Latin grammar, according
to their capacity. Yet others learnt reading, writing, and
French only. Morning school, which closed with prayer
at eleven, was devoted chiefly to the study of Latin. The
afternoon was given over entirely to French; and it does
not seem unreasonable to suppose that other scholars came
then specially for instruction in French. The pupils
returned for afternoon work at mid-day, and began by
translating French into English and then retranslated the
English back into French, using, we may be sure, Holyband's
<i>French Littleton</i>. Next came a little practice in vocabulary,
in which "maister Claude" asked them the French for
various English words. Grammar was not neglected, but
questions concerning it do not appear to have been invited
until some difficulty in the text rendered it necessary. The
pupils were also required to decline various nouns and
verbs which occurred in the text. The auxiliaries they were
expected to learn by heart. Not until five o'clock did the
long French lesson draw to a close, and then the scholars lit
their torches or lanterns and set off home after being dismissed
with evening prayers. Before their departure, they
received instructions to read the lesson for the following
day six or seven times after supper. By doing this, their
master assured them, it would appear easy on the morrow,
and be learnt without effort.</p>

<p>Holyband informs us that his charges were one shilling a
week or fifty shillings a year. He allows that this was more
than the fees asked for in most schools, but justifies the higher
charge by the superior instruction imparted. At any rate his
school was very prosperous. In 1568, when it had been in
existence for at least two, and perhaps three years, we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">-140-</a></span>find him
assisted by an usher, one John Henrycke, said to be a Frenchman.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
He was, no doubt, the Jehan Henry "Maistre d'Eschole,"
who wrote a dizain in praise of Holyband's <i>French Schoolemaister</i>
(1573), where, in rather questionable French, he
summoned the students of France to devote all their attention
to "ce poli et belle &#339;uvre," and not to read</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="fr"><span class="i0">Des ravaudeurs le reste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui souloyent quelques regles escrire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mais, au vray indignes de les lire.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p>Holyband, as we have noticed, was a very active and somewhat
restless person, never staying long in one place, and it
is difficult to follow him in his frequent changes of residence.
For a time he removed his school to Lewisham, then outside
London. Here, sometime before 1573, he had an interview
with Queen Elizabeth, who perhaps visited his school as
she passed through the village, for the head boy, Harry
Edmondes, pronounced a discourse before Her Majesty.</p>

<p>In 1576 Holyband had given up his French school, and
entered the ranks of French private tutors, living in the house
of a patron. He was one of the aliens dwelling in Salisbury
Court, the residence of Lord Buckhurst, and, no doubt, was
engaged in teaching French to the younger children of his
protector. He had previously come into contact with this
noble family, and had probably received some assistance from
this quarter on his arrival in England, and may have taught
French to the eldest son, Robert Sackville, now at Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
to whom he dedicated both his early works.</p>

<p>When we first hear of Holyband he was already married
and had children. His wife died probably before he went to
Salisbury Court. Two years later he married an Englishwoman,
Anne Smith,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> and had resumed his French school in
St. Paul's Churchyard, but his address was now at the sign of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">-141-</a></span>the Golden Bell,
<span class="sidenote">HOLYBAND'S TEACHING CAREER</span> for the printer Thomas Purfoote had moved
his sign to Newgate Market. Here he remained for some
time, until 1581 at the earliest, and probably somewhat
later. He also attended the French Church. At this period
of his life he again turned his attention to writing on the French
language, and collecting together notes which he had no doubt
compiled in past years. In 1580 three new works on French
appeared from his pen. One was a <i>Treatise for Declining
Verbs</i>&mdash;a subject which he calls "the second chiefest worke
of the Frenche tongue"&mdash;written at the request of several
gentlemen and merchants. The book itself is of little value,
and did not by any means share the popularity of his earliest
books. Still, two other editions appeared, one in 1599 and
the other much later, in 1641. The second of these works,
dealing with French pronunciation on much the same lines
as the <i>French Littleton</i>, was even less popular. It was
intended for the "learned," and consequently written in
Latin&mdash;<i>De Pronuntiatione linguae gallicae</i>.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Holyband was
also becoming more ambitious in his dedications; probably
through Lord Buckhurst, the queen's cousin on his mother's
side, he was able to dedicate his treatise "ad illustrissimam
simulque doctissimam Elizabetham Anglorum Reginam." At
the end Holyband added a dialogue in three different kinds
of spelling&mdash;the new, the old, and his own&mdash;as well as a
Latin sermon on the Resurrection. A French-English
Dictionary was the third of these works, published in 1580,
with the title: <i>The Treasurie of the French Tong, Teaching
the way to varie all sorts of Verbs, Enriched so plentifully
with Wordes and Phrases (for the benefit of the studious in that
language), as the like hath not before bin published.</i> Many
years later, in 1593, Holyband again gave proof of his deep
interest in French lexicography by the publication of his
<i>Dictionarie French and English, published for the benefit of the
studious in that language</i>, based on his earlier work, but on a
much larger scale.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile he had had an opportunity to extend his
knowledge and to refresh his mind by a long journey on the
Continent. Once more he had yielded to his love of change
and movement, and entered the service of another powerful
patron, Lord Zouche, to whom he dedicated his dictionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">-142-</a></span>of 1593. In the dedication we are told how he had undertaken
a "long, lointain, penible et dangereux voyage" with
his noble protector, who was to him "plutot pere ou baston
de vieillesse que non pas maistre, Seigneur ou commandeur."
Thus we may conclude that, when Lord Zouche crossed to
Hamburg by sea in March 1587, intending to qualify himself
for public service on the Continent, as well as to "live
cheaply," Holyband accompanied him, and, no doubt, found
many opportunities for serious study. They proceeded to
Heidelberg, where their names were inscribed on the
matriculation register of the university in May.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Zouche
then travelled to Frankfort, Basle (1588), Altdorf (1590),
and thence to Vienna (1591), and on to Verona, returning to
England in 1593.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>After the publication of this last of his works in 1593, we
lose sight of Holyband in his rôle of teacher of French. He
was, however, still in England in 1597, when he dedicated a
new edition of his <i>French Littleton</i> to a new patron, Lord
Herbert of Swansea. Thereafter he is not mentioned, and
subsequent editions of his most popular works&mdash;the <i>Schoolemaister</i>
and <i>French Littleton</i>&mdash;were issued without his supervision.
Probably he had returned to his native country, for
in the last of his published works he assumes the title of
"gentilhomme bourbonnais," which suggests that he had come
into the possession of some property in his native province,
where his name was still known in the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
Certain it is that he did not remain in England. There is no
further trace of his children, of whom he had at least four.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
Thus silently, as if forgetful of his former habits, he slipped
out of sight after he had spent nearly forty years teaching
his language in England. He won the praise of the scholar
Richard Mulcaster, soon to be appointed Head of St. Paul's
School, near which Holyband had so long had his own modest
establishment; and the poet George Gascoigne wrote a
sonnet in his honour:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Holyband, like his predecessor Du Ploich, was an advocate
of the practical teaching of languages. A perfect knowledge
of French, in his eyes, consisted in being able to read and
pronounce the language accurately. Thus the first thing to be
done by those desiring to study the language is to begin to read
at once. The learner must not "entangle himself at the first
brunte" with rules; but, "after he hath read them over, let
him take in hand the dialogues, and as occasion requireth
he shall examine the rules, applying their use unto his purpose."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
He must first "frame his tongue by reading them
aloud, noting carefully which letters are not pronounced,
looking for the reasons why they are lefte in the rules of
pronunciation," so that "when he shall happen uppon other
bookes printed without these caracters he may remember
which letters ought to be uttered and which ought not." In
these rules<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Holyband endeavours to explain French sounds
by comparison with English sounds. His treatment of the
letter <i>a</i> may be given as an example of his method. "Sound
our <i>a</i>," he says,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> "as you sound the first sillable in Laurence, or
Augustine in English. When <i>a</i> is joined with <i>in</i> it loseth his
sound, or at the least it is very little heard: as <i>pain</i>, <i>hautain</i>....
Pronounce then as if they were written thus: <i>pin</i>,
<i>hautin</i>.... But if <i>e</i> followeth <i>n</i>, then <i>i</i> goeth more towards
<i>n</i>, thus: <i>balaine</i>, <i>semaine</i> ...," and then he proceeds to
describe in like fashion the sounds of the diphthong <i>ai</i>.
His treatment of the sound <i>gn</i> is quaint and interesting.
"When you find any word written with <i>gn</i>, remember
how you pronounce these English words, <i>onion</i>, <i>minion</i>,
<i>companion</i>, and such like: so melting <i>g</i>, and touching smoothly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">-144-</a></span>the roofe of the mouth with the flat of the tongue, say: <i>mignon</i>,
<i>oignon</i>, <i>compagnon</i>; say then, <i>cam-pa-gne</i>, <i>campa-gnie</i>, and
not <i>cam-pag-ne</i>, <i>campag-nie</i>, separating <i>g</i> from <i>n</i>; but rather
sound them as if they were written thus in your English
tongue, <i>campaine</i>, <i>campanie</i>."</p>

<p>Such rules alone, however, were of little value in Holyband's
opinion, and we cheerfully agree with him. The reader must
be very circumspect in his use of them, and his teacher a
very skilful Frenchman, "or else all will go to wracke." He
seems to have thought that much more depended on the tutor
than on rules. No doubt he fully shared the opinion stated
earlier by Duwes, that rules are of more use to the teacher
than the learner. "Oh how busie is this tongue," he says of
French, "and into what maze doth the learner enter which
doth take it in hand: therefore let his tutor be sevenfold
skilfull." We are prepared, then, to find Holyband agreeing
with Henry VIII.'s tutor on another point&mdash;the teaching
of French and writing of French grammars by the English.
To him it appeared obvious that "it is not the part of a
stranger, except he be learned and of a long continuance in
France, to give precepts concerning the pronunciation of the
(French) tongue: yea neither of the best Frenchmen, be he
never so learned or eloquent in the same, except he hath
practised the premises by teaching or otherwise by a long
and diligent observation." There can be no question of
committing rules to memory; they merely serve to throw
light on the reading matter. Yet the practice of memorizing
is not neglected. There were two purposes for which
it was called into use, the verbs, chiefly the two auxiliaries,
and vocabulary, to which Holyband attached much importance.</p>

<p>According to Holyband himself, his method had excellent
results. He was especially proud of the pronunciation of his
pupils. In teaching this he followed a plan which strikes the
modern reader as curious, but which had already been employed
in an early sixteenth-century grammar, that of the
poet Alexander Barclay. According to this plan he taught
his scholars the main characteristics of the different dialects
of France, as well as the pure French in which they were
encouraged to speak. His reason for doing so was to put
them on their guard against the variety of dialects, chiefly
Picard and Walloon, spoken by the numerous refugees
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH CHURCH SCHOOLS</span>scattered all over London. When new scholars came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">-145-</a></span> his
school from "other French schools," he assures us that on hearing
them speak and pronounce any letter incorrectly, his own pupils
"spie the faultes as soone as I, yea they cannot abide it: and
which is more they will discerne whether the maister which
taught them first was a Burgonian, a Norman, or a Houyet."</p>

<p>The reading, which Holyband made the basis of his language
teaching, was always explained by means of English
renderings. In his dialogues he makes no attempt to retain the
purity of the English phrase. English for him was merely a
vehicle for interpreting to his young scholars the meaning
of the French, "for I do not pretend to teach them any other
thing then the French tongue," and so he begs his readers
not to "muse" at the English of his book, but to take the
French with such goodwill as it is offered. It will be noticed
that on this point, as on many others&mdash;placing the rules
after the practical exercises, for instance&mdash;Holyband resembles
Du Ploich, and no doubt he was acquainted with
the <i>Treatise</i> of his less well known fellow-teacher. The
points of resemblance between the dialogues of the two works
are sufficient proof of this, although Du Ploich's cannot
compare with Holyband's in interest. Another work which
had some influence on his dialogues was the <i>Linguae Latinae
Exercitatio</i> of the great Spanish scholar and educationist
Vives&mdash;a book containing Latin dialogues, dealing with the
life of the schoolboy at home and at school, at work and at
play. This was a very popular school-book in the sixteenth
century, and was most likely used by Holyband in the Latin
lessons at his own school. He also incorporated the Latin
dialogues of Vives in a work which he called the <i>Campo di
Fior, or flowery field of four languages, Italian, Latin, French
and English</i>, giving the dialogues in these four languages. This
work appeared in 1583, when he was probably still teaching
in St. Paul's Churchyard.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>Besides these French schools kept by private individuals,
there were others in connexion with the French churches. After
the foundation of the French Church in Threadneedle Street,
other churches had arisen in different parts of the country.
The education of the children attending these institutions
had to be seen to, and very soon schools were established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">-146-</a></span>under the supervision of the churches themselves.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Although
these schools were primarily intended for the instruction of
the children of the refugees, they also undertook to teach
those "who would wish to learn the French language." Just
as some English attended the services of the French Church,
so also some sent their children to the school associated
with it. And it must be remembered that to some Englishmen
the French Church presented greater attractions than
the English Church did at that time; for there naturally
grew up a bond of sympathy between the Protestant refugees
and the English Nonconformists, many of whom sought
in the French Church, with its Genevan discipline, a form
of worship not sanctioned by the English Church. Others
attended these churches for the same reason as the "Italianate
gentleman," censured by Roger Ascham,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> went to the Italian
Church: "to heare the (French) tongue naturally spoken, not
to heare God's doctrine trewly preached." This was a practice
strongly advocated by many of the French teachers of the
time. The number of Englishmen of both kinds must have
been considerable. In 1573 Elizabeth issued an Order forbidding
the French Church to give communion to those
English who, by curiosity or dislike for their own ceremonies,
wished to receive it in the French Church. The church in
Threadneedle Street took steps to limit the number of its
English adherents. These were required to produce evidence
of a sober life, and of loyalty to their own church, before they
were allowed to communicate.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> English names are not uncommon
in the Threadneedle Street Registers. Even members
of the nobility stood as sponsors to the children of the

Earl of Pembroke, and the Countess of Bedford, in the year
1624.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> The French Church at Southampton also had numerous

<span class="sidenote">FRENCH SCHOOL AT CANTERBURY</span>the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">-147-</a></span>esteem in which the French churches were held by
many Englishmen, we may assume that some of the latter were
glad to take advantage of the willingness of the French Church
to receive their children into its schools. The refugees, on their
part, did not always send their children to their own schools.
The sons of the wealthier strangers would go to the English
grammar schools, and thence, in many cases, to the University.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The subjects taught in these French church schools were, no
doubt, much the same as those of the private French schools,
including religious instruction, writing, reading, arithmetic,
and possibly music. The curriculum appears to have been
of quite an elementary nature. As to the teachers, they were
required to be of sober life, and members of the French
Church. They had to be appointed by the minister and
presented to the bishop. They also were required to give
the minister an account of the books they read to the children,
and of the methods followed, and be willing to adopt the
advice of their superiors "sans rien entreprendre à leur
fantaisie." Further, it was their duty to conduct the children
to church on Sunday for the catechism.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Such were the
regulations laid down in the second Discipline, drawn up on
the restoration of the French Church after the accession of
Elizabeth. When this was revised some years later, in 1588,
a few changes were made. The presentation to the bishop
was dispensed with, and the teachers were no longer obliged
to conduct the children to the catechism: they had only
to prepare them to answer it. And the ministers, on their
side, were required to visit the schools, accompanied by the
elders and deacons, at least four times a year; their attention
was specially called to "those who teach languages."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The French teachers attached to the Church at Canterbury
are those of whom we have most detailed information. In one
of the articles of a petition, which the group of refugees there
addressed to the city authorities, in the reign of Elizabeth, they
crave that permission may be given to the schoolmaster whom
they have brought with them to teach both their own youth
and also other children who desire to learn the French tongue.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">-148-</a></span>Their request appears to have been well received, as a French
church and school were established not long after. Among the
names of the petitioners was that of Vincent Primont, teacher
of youth, who seems to have been the first schoolmaster of
this little community. He was a refugee from Normandy,
and arrived at Rye in 1572.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> To the office of schoolmaster,
which he held for many years, was added that of Reader to
the congregation&mdash;a post he resigned in 1584, owing to some
action of the consistory which did not meet with his approval.
The last mention we have of him, as schoolmaster, occurs in
December 1583, when a member of the congregation was
reproved for allowing his workmen to set a bad example to
Master Vincent's scholars. He probably filled his position for
some time after this date. In August 1581, however, another
teacher, Nicholas du Buisson, obtained permission "to go
from house to house to teach children," and in 1583 received
a small quarterly allowance for taking charge of the children
at the services in the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The demand for teachers
apparently increased considerably at this time; in 1582
we hear of a third schoolmaster, Paul Le Pipre, who had
already been teaching for some time previous to this date.
Le Pipre several times took steps to defend his monopoly and
prevent the admission of other schoolmasters. In 1582 he
opposed the application of Jan Roboem or Jean Robone,
who sought permission to hold school. Roboem, who had
been Reader in the French Protestant Church at Dieppe,
fled thence to Rye in 1572, in company with his wife and
two children.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> He was in very poor estate on arriving at
Canterbury, and the consistory of the French Church at last
prevailed on Le Pipre to agree to his admission, promising
him that if any disadvantage accrued to him thereby it should
be remedied. Roboem was therefore told he might put his
notice on the door of the Temple&mdash;the usual form of advertisement&mdash;whenever
he pleased.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> He did not, however, keep it
there long, moving to London in the same year. He is no
doubt to be identified with the John Robonin, "schoolmaster of
the French tongue," who was living in the "Warde of Chepe,"
and attending the French Church, at the end of 1582.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PAUL LE PIPRE</span>Paul Le Pipre was again approached in 1583 with regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">-149-</a></span>
to the appointment of another schoolmaster, probably a
successor to Robonin. He was told that another teacher
was necessary, and that one had come forward, a destitute
refugee, who wished for permission to teach in order to earn
his living. Le Pipre replied "that he held to his agreement
with the Church, namely that he could not leave without
giving three months' notice." Ultimately it was decided
"that the aforesaid should not be permitted to keep school,
both on account of the agreement and because he was not
as yet sufficiently known to be of the religion." This teacher,
whose name is not given, was, however, allowed to instruct
"certain married people, and others grown up and over fourteen
years of age who did not go to Paul's school, in consideration
of his poverty."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>Paul Le Pipre retained the position he was so unwilling to
share with a colleague, for many years after this. The last
we hear of him is in September 1597, when he was censured
by the consistory for holding school on Sunday.</p>

<p>French schools likewise arose in other provincial towns,
where French Churches had been established. There were
also, it appears, similar private schools, with the primary
object of teaching French to the English, and unconnected
with the churches. At any rate, French and Walloon
schoolmasters arrived in some of these towns. At Rye in
1572, for instance, we come across Nicholas Curlew and
Martin Martin, fugitives from Dieppe,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> though probably, like
Vincent Primont and John Robone, they did not settle in
the town. At Norwich, in 1568, was a Pierre de Rieu of Lille
who had arrived ten months before, and in 1622 Francis Boy
and John Cokele.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> At Dover, in the same year, Francis
Rowland and Nicholas Rowsignoll, both French schoolmasters,
had "come out of France by reason of the late troubles yet
continuing."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> And lastly, at Southampton, we hear in 1576
of Nicholas Chemin, who, in 1578, was refused communion
at the church on account of his causing some disturbance in
the congregation; of a M. Du Plantin, dit Antoine Ylot, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">-150-</a></span>1576, and of a Pierre de la Motte, 'mestre d'escolle,' in 1577.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
No doubt most of these schoolmasters taught under the
auspices of the French Churches.</p>

<p>M. Du Plantin was one of a large number of ministers who
took refuge in England, and his school was probably a French
Church school, for seven of his young scholars are mentioned
as communicants. Many French pastors like him, no doubt,
took to the teaching profession during their stay in England,
their numbers being far in excess of the ministers needed in
the churches. The famous reformer, John Utenhove of Ghent,
was in 1549 tutor to the son of a London gentleman.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
Valerand Poullain, a converted priest, who, after being pastor
at Strasburg, came to England, for a time held a similar post
in the household of the Earl of Derby;<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> he afterwards became
minister of the French Church at Glastonbury on the recommendation
of Utenhove. Another minister, Jean Louveau,
Sieur de la Porte, spent the time of exile from his Church of
Roche Bernard, after the massacre of St. Bartholomew, in
teaching languages in London, and there were many others in
like case.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>At Southampton there was a French school of special
interest. Its teacher, like Du Plantin, was a pastor, though
the school does not seem to have had any close connexion
with the French Church. This schoolmaster and divine was
the once famous Dr. Adrian Saravia, a learned refugee from
Flanders. He became later Professor of Divinity at Leyden
and an intimate friend of Casaubon; and when he took refuge
in England for a second time in 1587, he enjoyed some
ecclesiastical preferment, and was one of the translators of
the Authorised Version of the Bible.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> During his first sojourn
in England, however, he was engaged on a more humble task.
He first arrived at Southampton in about 1567,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> after having
been for some years headmaster of a grammar school in
Guernsey. Saravia's school at Southampton was limited to
sixteen or twenty youths of good family. It was a rule
that all the scholars should speak French. Any one who
used English, "though only a word," was obliged to wear a
fool's cap at meals, and continue to wear it until he caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">-151-</a></span>another in the same fault.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH SCHOOL AT SOUTHAMPTON</span>Two Englishmen, who later
became well known as translators, acquired their knowledge
of French in this school. One was Joshua Sylvester, famous
for his translation of Du Bartas, and the other Robert Ashley,
who turned Louis le Roy's <i>De la Vicissitude ou Variété des
choses de l'univers</i> (1579) into English (1594). Sylvester
informs us that he learnt his French at Saravia's school "in
three poor years, at three times three years old"; "I have
never been in France," he writes to his uncle, William Plumb,
"whereby I might become so perfect." Elsewhere he expresses
his affection for his master and his debt of gratitude to him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My Saravia, to whose revered name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine owes the honour of Du Bartas' fame.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Sylvester did not put his knowledge of French into practice
only by translations into English. He also wrote some
original verses in French; the sonnet with which he offered
to James I. his translation of the works of Du Bartas, a poet
for whom the king had a great admiration, will show his
skill in a difficult art:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</span></div></div>

<p>Another of Sylvester's contemporaries at Saravia's school
was Sir Thomas Lake,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> who became Secretary of State in the
reign of James I., and is said to have read Latin and French
to Queen Elizabeth towards the end of her reign. His French
accent, unlike that of his schoolfellows, seems to have left
much to be desired. In 1612 he incurred much ridicule by
reading the French contract of marriage at the wedding of
the Princess Elizabeth to the Elector with a very bad accent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">-152-</a></span>Saravia, it seems, encouraged his pupils to attend the
French Church. Two of their names occur in the registers of
the Church for the year 1576, viz. Nicholas Essard and
Nicholas Carye, both probably Englishmen. Saravia himself
and his wife were also regular attenders; in 1571 and again in
1576 he stood godfather at baptisms. The latest mention of
him occurs in 1577. Usually the descriptive title "minister"
is added after his name.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> He is mentioned in the town
records under the year 1576 as Master of the Grammar
School, and in the following year the town paid 36s. "for
four yardes of broade cloth for a gowne for Mr. Adrian
Saravia the schoolmaster at 9s. the yarde."<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Apparently he
had abandoned his private school, although it is very likely
that he continued to take private pupils into his house, and
that the grammar school scholars had ample opportunity
to learn French; but it is hardly probable that he introduced
the language into the grammar school curriculum, where, no
doubt, Latin retained its usual supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that in the England of the sixteenth century
French had no footing in the ordinary schools, but was taught
in a growing number of small private schools kept by Frenchmen,
French-speaking refugees from the Netherlands, and
sometimes by Englishmen.</p>

<p>In Scotland, on the other hand, French received more
recognition in the grammar schools, although it did not form
part of the ordinary curriculum, which was based on Latin,
as in England. Yet in several schools its use was distinctly
encouraged on lines which, we may conclude, were followed
at Southampton grammar school in Saravia's time. For
instance, the boys of Aberdeen grammar school, in the
middle of the sixteenth century, were enjoined to address
each other in French, while the use of the vernacular was
forbidden. In the famous grammar school of Perth, when
John Rowe, the reformer, was master there, and many of
the scholars boarded with him, we are informed that "as
they spake nothing in the schoole and fields but Latine so
nothing was spoken in his house but French." It is of
interest to note that in this school French is put side by side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">-153-</a></span>with
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH IN THE SCHOOLS OF SCOTLAND</span>the ancient tongues, as Palsgrave had wished.
After
meals a selection from the Bible was read; if from the Old
Testament, in Hebrew, if from the New Testament, in Latin,
Greek, or French.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Turning to the more elementary education, we find French
holding a still larger place in some of the parish schools of
Scotland, where it was taught as part of the regular course
by the side of Latin. An interesting account of one of these
schools has been left by James Melville, in his diary.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> He
records that in 1566, at the age of seven, he, together with his
elder brother, was sent to a school kept by a kinsman, minister
at Logie, a few miles from Montrose. This "guid, lerned,
kind man" attended to the children's education, while his sister
was "a verie loving mother" to them, and to a "guid number
of gentle and honest mens berns of the country about," who also
were at the school. "Ther we lerned," he continues, "to reid
the catechisme, prayers and scripture, to rehers the catechisme
and prayers par c&#339;ur.... We lerned ther the Rudiments
of the Latin grammar, with the vocables in Latin and French,
also divers speitches in Frenche, with the reading and right
pronunciation of that toung." Melville also assures us that
his master had "a verie guid and profitable form of resolving
the authors," and that he treated them "grammaticallie,
bothe according to etymologie and syntaxe"; but, unfortunately,
he gives us no further details on the teaching of
French. After spending five years at this school, where, he
admits, he learnt but little, "for his understanding was yet
dark," he went to the grammar school at Montrose. There,
although he had a French Protestant refugee, Pierre de
Marsilliers, to teach him Greek, he does not appear to
have had occasion to continue his study of the French
tongue.</p>

<p>In Scotland, as in England, there were also special schools
for teaching French. For instance, the French schoolmaster
Nicholas Langlois, or Inglishe, who came to England in 1569,
and in 1571 was installed in Blackfriars, London, with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">-154-</a></span>wife and two children,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> moved to Scotland in about 1574. He
opened a French school in Edinburgh, which was subsidized
by the Town Council, and where he taught French, arithmetic
and accounts until the time of his death in 1611. The Town
Council of Aberdeen also showed itself favourable to French
schools; in 1635 it granted to a certain Alexander Rolland
a licence "to teach a French school," and allowed him "for
that effect to put up one brod or signe befoir his schoole door."</p>

<p>Yet in spite of the fact that French received greater recognition
in the schools of Scotland than it did in those of England,
there is nothing to show that the same general interest was
taken in the study of the language. While in England large
numbers of grammars and other text-books were published,
there is only one notice of the production of a similar work in
Scotland during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This
solitary work, which a certain William Nudrye received a
licence to print in 1559,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> was entitled <i>Ane A B C for Scottes
men to read the frenche toung, with an exhortation to the nobles
of Scotland to favour their old friends</i>. The plea that French
was learnt by the help of French grammars imported from
France, or on conversational methods, or yet again in France
by direct intercourse with Frenchmen, may be applied with as
much force to England as to Scotland, though it is not improbable
that in Scotland such methods were relied on to a
greater extent; the friendly relations which existed between
Scotland and France from the thirteenth century onwards
encouraged large numbers of Scots to seek instruction in
France, just as it led some Frenchmen to the Scottish centres
of learning.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> French tutors were said to be as common in
Scotland as in England; a Spanish ambassador reported to
Ferdinand and Isabella as early as 1498 that "there is a
good deal of French education in Scotland, and many speak
the French language." Yet the fact remains that while one
small French A B C appears to have been the only work on
the language issued in Scotland, there was a whole series of
such works published in England.</p>

in the registers of aliens. There was a John Henryke, a "Dutchman," who, in 1567,
was living in Broadstreet Ward, and had been three weeks in England; and, in 1571,
in St. Mary Alchurch Parish, when he is said to have been five years in England, and
to be a native of Barowe in Brabant and nineteen years old. In 1582 one of the same
name was living in Blackfriars and had two servants (Hug. Soc. Pub. x. pt i. p. 322;
pt. ii. pp. 91, 253). In 1579 a John Hendricke from the dominion of the Bishop of
Liége received letters of denization (Hug. Soc. Pub. viii. ad nom.). It does not seem

<h3>HUGUENOT TEACHERS OF FRENCH&mdash;OTHER CLASSES OF FRENCH
TEACHERS&mdash;RIVALRIES IN THE PROFESSION&mdash;THE "DUTCH"
AND ENGLISH TEACHERS</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen that some of the refugees who came to England
as a result of the persecutions in France and the Netherlands
were professional schoolmasters; others joined the profession
on their arrival, through force of circumstances, or as
a means of repaying hospitality. The lot of such teachers
varied considerably. Some lived and taught in gentlemen's
families; others thrived by waiting on a private aristocratic
clientèle; others gained a more precarious livelihood under
less powerful patronage; and yet others opened private schools,
often with decided success. Many of these teachers<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> were
denizens, and had long teaching careers, chiefly in London;
a certain Abraham Bushell, for instance, a native of "Rotchell,"
had been a "schoolmaster of the French tongue"
in London for twenty-two years in 1618, during which
time he had attended the French Church. Many other
French teachers were members of the French Church, which
naturally, seeing that it fostered a French school itself, took a
particular interest in the French schoolmasters generally. Thus
in 1560 all French schoolmasters having schools in London
were summoned before the consistory, which was seeking to
ascertain how many belonged to the Church, and also what
book they used in teaching the children. Eight were ready
to conform to the Church and its discipline;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> a ninth, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">-156-</a></span>Gilles Berail, refused to conform, on the plea that he attended
the English parish church and understood English as well
as French.</p>

<p>With the exception of Holyband, the chief Huguenot
teachers who gathered round St. Paul's Churchyard would seem
to have been Normans. One of these was Robert Fontaine,
a friend of Holyband. He had a long and varied career in
England as a teacher of French. Arriving in 1550, he remained
in England during the reign of Mary, modifying his
religious convictions to suit the exigencies of the time. He
returned to his former faith early in the reign of Elizabeth,
and expressed contrition for his "falling off to idolatry."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
He attended the French Church faithfully in the early time
of its revival, but he appears to have gone more frequently
to the Anglican Church in later years, and possibly his sympathies
were more in that direction. The favourite neighbourhood,
St. Paul's Churchyard, was the scene of his activities,
and there he lived for many years with one of his countrymen,
Mr. Bowry, a purse-maker. In 1571 he had been living
seventeen years in the vicinity of the Cathedral, and in 1582,
the latest mention of him in the returns of aliens, he was still
in the same district, and appears to have been very prosperous.</p>

<p>Some of this group of Normans added to their activities
that of writing books for teaching French&mdash;an occupation for
which Fontaine, presumably, had not time or inclination.
One such author was Jacques Bellot, a "gentleman of the city
of Caen in Normandie," who came to England in 1578, or the
end of 1577, probably driven from his native land by the
persecutions. He was received into the household of Sir
Philip Wharton, third baron of that name, and in a surprisingly
short time produced a French Grammar, which he
dedicated to his patron, with an expression of his gratitude.
Bellot, it appears, had already a considerable connexion.
His work is preceded by numerous commendatory poems,
after the fashion of the time. The poet Thomas Newton
of Chester wrote two of these, one in Latin and the other
in English, laying stress on the debt due by his countrymen
to these French grammarians:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">-157-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">JACQUES BELLOT</span>
<span class="i0">Thankes therefore great and threefold thankes are due<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By right to those, whose travaile, toyle and penne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dothe breake the yce for others to ensue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By rules and practice for us Englishmen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An easye way, a methode most in use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amonge the Learn'de t' enduce to knowledge sure.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Other verses are written in French by John and William
Wroth, no doubt two of the numerous sons of the politician
Sir Thomas Wroth.</p>

<p>This new work, entitled <i>The French Grammar, or An Introduction
orderly and Methodically by ready rules, playne preceptes
and evident examples, teachinge the French Tongue</i>, differs
from the popular books of Holyband, and also from most
other French manuals, in that it deals with grammar alone.
It opens with the usual observations on pronunciation. Each
letter is taken in turn, and the position of the organs necessary
to produce it is given. The author makes no attempt to
compare the French sounds with the English equivalents.
He had probably not yet had time to master the intricacies
of English pronunciation, although the whole book is written
in English; and he also, no doubt, made free use of grammars
written in France. He tells us, for instance, that "<i>c</i> ought to
be pronounced with the tongue against the roof of the mouth,
and the mouth somewhat open"; that "<i>f</i> is pronounced holding
the nether lip against the upward teeth"; and that "<i>h</i> is but
aspiration, which loseth his sound after <i>e</i> feminine, and also
after every consonant." Then, after a few general observations
and lists of numbers, months, and other familiar words, we
reach the second part of the Grammar, which deals with
the eight parts of speech. Each is defined and commented
on in turn. The wording is often quaint; for instance, verbs
are defined as "words which be declined with Modes and
tenses, and are betokenynge doing." This second book treats
of the accidence. In the third we pass to the consideration
of syntax with the following warning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="fr"><span class="i0">Dire, <i>sy ay</i> (quoy qu'usage on en face)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">N'est point parlé en courtois et bien nay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bien seant n'est aussy, dire, <i>non ay</i>:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sauf votre honneur</i>, ou bien <i>sauf votre grace</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seroient trouvéz de trop meilleure grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Je ne l'ay fait</i>, est trop desordonné:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pardonnez moy</i>, seroit mieux ordonné,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Car grand fureur douce parolle efface.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nous estions</i>, <i>Nous y pensons</i>, faut dire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non, <i>J'estions</i>, on ne s'en fait que rire,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">-158-</a></span><span class="i0">Ne <i>J'y pensons</i>, tout cela est repris.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Les bons François ne parlent point ainsy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acunement pris ne doit estre aussy<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Petit</i>, pour <i>peu</i>, ny <i>peu</i> pour <i>petit</i> pris.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">This part of the work is not extensive, and consists of a miscellaneous
collection of observations; we are, for instance, told
that the antecedent governs its relative, that the adjective
agrees with its noun, and we are supplied also with rules for the
gender and number, the negative, and so on. To this Bellot
adds a fourth book, which is perhaps the most curious part of
the work. It deals with French versification. We are first
favoured with a description of the structure of various forms
of poems, such as the "chant royal," the "ballade," the
sonnet, rondeau, "dixain," and so on, each accompanied by an
example, by way of illustration. The various forms of rime
are next described and exemplified; and some of the complicated
forms dear to the "rhétoriqueurs" find a place
here. This is followed by a description of the various kinds
of metres, again with examples; and finally rhythm, colour
or "lizière," the caesura, elision, the "coupe féminine," and
the use of the apostrophe are treated. Such is this little
treatise on the "French poeme," which shows incidentally
that Bellot had not yet learned the lesson enforced by the
<i>Pléiade</i> more than twenty years before he wrote.</p>

<p>What strikes one most, perhaps, in Bellot's Grammar is
that he makes no attempt to deal with the difficulties which
the French language presents to the English in particular.
No comparison of the two languages is instituted; no emphasis
is laid on points in which they differ. Were it not
written in English, it might be taken for a study of the language
on the model of those produced in France. Considering
that the work was published in the year of his arrival in
England, it seems almost certain that he had begun his study
before his arrival, and translated it himself, or had it translated
into English. This would account for its unusual character.</p>

<p>Bellot opens and closes his Grammar with apologies.
He repudiates all claim to completeness, and writes, he says,
merely to provoke the "learned" to do better. "Yet the
worke is not so leane and voide of fruite, but there is in it
some taste. The bee gathereth honey from the smallest
flowers, and so may the wise man from this small work."</p>

<p>Some time after the publication of his Grammar, he joined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">-159-</a></span>the group
of French teachers dwelling in the neighbourhood
of St. Paul's Churchyard. He was there in 1582, and
made the acquaintance of Holyband, who had then resumed
his French school in that locality. In the following year he
wrote a quatrain and a sonnet in praise of Holyband's latest
work, the <i>Campo di Fior</i> (1583):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="fr"><span class="i0">Goustez Anglois, Gent bien heureuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Les fleurs qu'en vostre Isle argenteuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vous donne Holybande pour un gage.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">It is not certain how Bellot employed his time there. He
may have had a school, or have taught privately. In any
case he was a member of the French Church, and in the
returns of aliens he calls himself a "schoolmaster" and a
"teacher of children."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> But the title on which he is most
insistent is that of "gentleman." He is a "gentilhomme
cadomois," or a gentleman of Caen, and usually attaches the
abbreviation G.C. to his name. His attitude to the usual
type of French teacher is distinctly supercilious. He prided
himself on belonging to the "noblesse instruite et de Savoir,"
and had the reputation of teaching elegant French.</p>

<p>In 1580 he dedicated to no less a person than François de
Valois,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> brother to Henry III., a work for teaching English
to foreigners. Like Holyband, he gave his book the title of
"Schoolmaster": <i>Maistre d'Escole Anglois pour les naturelz
françois, et autre estrangers qui ont la langue françoyse, pour
parvenir a la vraye prononciation de la langue Angloise</i>.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The
work contains rules of pronunciation and grammar, given
in opposite columns in French and English; it was evidently
written in French in the first place, and then somewhat carelessly
translated into English, for in the English column the
illustrative examples are given in French. This produces
a curious effect, and involves such statements as: "<i>quand</i>
should be pronounced as <i>Houen</i>" (when), etc. In the dedication
he refers to his "misfortune," by which, presumably, he
means his exile.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Bellot was busily occupied in the production of other text-books
also during his residence in Paul's Churchyard. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">-160-</a></span><i>Maistre d'Escole Anglois</i> appeared in January 1580, and in 1581
was followed by a third work, in the form of a collection of
moral dicta, entitled <i>Le Jardin de vertu et bonnes m&#339;urs plain
de plusieurs belles fleurs et riches sentences, avec le sens d'icelles,
recueillies de plusieurs autheurs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and intended to be used as a
"reader." It was published by the French refugee printer
Thomas Vautrollier, who, at the same time, issued a new
edition of Holyband's <i>French Littleton</i>. The works of the
two friends were of the same size, and are bound together in
the copy preserved in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Holyband, with his long-standing reputation, may have
been able to further Bellot's interests. In 1580 he had
dedicated his Latin work on French pronunciation to the
queen, and in the following year Bellot obtained the same
favour for his little work. He accordingly opened his book
with six French sonnets in honour of Her Majesty, celebrating
her generous reception of strangers, not omitting to beg
her protection for the "garden":</p>

<p class="noi">The whole of the <i>Jardin</i> is printed in French and English;
each maxim or saying is accompanied by explanations of the
most difficult words, by means of synonyms, paraphrases,

<p>It will be noticed that Bellot had not fully mastered the
English idiom, although he had written an English grammar.
The rest of the "beautiful flowers of vertue" which he planted
in his "garden" are similar in character and treatment. He
characteristically closes his little book with a prayer, which
he quaintly compares to a fence to keep the "goats" from
harming the "flowers."</p>

<p>In 1583 Bellot was still living near St. Paul's Churchyard.
But after this date we lose all trace of him until 1588, when
the printer Robert Robinson received a licence to print
"a booke intytuled a grammar in Frenche and Englishe, the
auttour is James Bellot."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> This second French Grammar
was known as <i>The French Methode</i>.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>To the numerous band of Normans in England also belonged,
perhaps, G. De la Mothe, who wrote the letter "N"
after his name. De la Mothe was another refugee for the sake
of religion, and he speaks with gratitude of the generous
welcome he received in England.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> He tells us that the cruel
civil wars in France had "burnt the wings of his studies"
and ruined his fortune.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> On his arrival in England, he began
his career as a teacher of French in the same way as many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">-162-</a></span>others; he became a tutor in a noble family, and shortly
after produced a book for teaching French. He was first
appointed French tutor to the son of Sir Henry Wallop,
Lord Chief Justice of Ireland and a prominent patron of the
refugees, on the return of his lordship to England in 1589.
De la Mothe was also received, at some date before 1592, into
the midst of another important English family, the Wenmans,
of Thame Park, Oxfordshire. He taught French to the girls,
and early in 1592, if not before, was at Oxford with the eldest
son, Richard Wenman,<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> afterwards Sir Richard, and his
brothers.</p>

<p>De la Mothe had in the meantime written a French text-book
which he called <i>The French Alphabet, Teaching in a very
short time by a most easie way, to pronounce French naturally,
to read it perfectly, to unite it truly, and to speak it accordingly,
Together with a Treasure of the French Tongue</i>.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> He divided
it into two parts, which he dedicated to each of his patrons&mdash;the
first to Sir Henry Wallop and the second to Sir Richard
Wenman's mother, at whose request he had undertaken the
work. De la Mothe acknowledges his debt of gratitude to
both, and also to the country which had received him so
hospitably, in terms which contain something more than the
usual trite expressions.</p>

<p>The <i>French Alphabet</i> was licensed to the printer Richard
Field in 1592,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> but no copy of this earliest edition has been
preserved. Field succeeded to Vautrollier's successful business,
and in this same year showed his friendship for his fellow-townsman<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
Shakespeare, by printing the first work he published,
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>. It is of course pure conjecture to
suggest that Shakespeare saw and even read the little book
printed by his friend. Whether this be so or not, it was
perhaps through Field and his Huguenot connexions&mdash;he
had married Vautrollier's widow&mdash;that Shakespeare became
acquainted with the family of Christopher Montjoy.</p>

<p>
A <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">-163-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">G. DE LA MOTHE, N.</span>
new edition of the <i>Alphabet</i> appeared in 1595, from the
press of Edward Alde. At this date De la Mothe had joined
the group of teachers in St. Paul's Churchyard. He taught
at the "Signe of the Helmet," and "there you shall finde
him ever willing to show you any favour or curtesie he may;
and most ready to endeavour himselfe to satisfie you in all
that can be possible for hime to doe." The Sign of the
Helmet was the address of the bookseller Thomas Chard.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
Any one desirous of becoming acquainted with the author for
his better furtherance in the French tongue could also make
enquiries at the Sign of St. John the Evangelist in Fleet
Street, beneath the Conduit, where lived the printer and
bookseller Hugh Jackson, commissioned to sell the book&mdash;further
instances of the friendly relations between the French
teachers and the printers and booksellers of the time, through
whom these teachers would, no doubt, get a large proportion
of their clientèle. The Huguenot sympathies of many of the
printers, such as Vautrollier and Field, account in part for
this cordial feeling.</p>

<p>After the 1595 edition of his work we hear nothing further
of De la Mothe. Although the name occurs frequently in
the returns of aliens, none can be identified with him. He
probably seized an early opportunity of returning to his
native land. His manual, however, did not disappear with him.
Second in popularity only to the works of Holyband in the
sixteenth century, it enjoyed numerous editions in the seventeenth.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
Excepting the omission of De la Mothe's advertisement,
all the later editions are identical. They were issued
from the press of Field's successor, George Miller.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> It is
difficult to understand how the 1595 edition came to be
printed by Edward Alde, though his work was evidently countenanced
by De la Mothe.</p>

<p>The <i>French Alphabet</i> is a very practical little work. It
contains rules for pronunciation and familiar dialogues in the
usual style. The whole is given in French and English
arranged on opposite pages. His treatment of pronunciation
is much the same as Holyband's, and he sometimes transcribes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">-164-</a></span>freely from his active contemporary's work.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> He explains the
sounds chiefly by comparison with English, giving the nearest
equivalent to each letter. After the letters he deals with the
syllables and then the words. The rules are arranged in
the form of dialogues between master and pupil:</p>
<div class="table">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="French alphabet">
<tr><td>Sir, will it please you do me so much favour (or would you take the pain) to teach me to speak French?</td>
<td><span lang="fr">Monsieur, vous plaist il me faire tant de faveur (ou voudriez vous prendre la peine) de m'apprendre a parler François?</span></td></tr>

<tr><td>With all my heart, if you have a desire to it.</td>
<td><span lang="fr">Tres volontiers, si vous en avez envie.</span></td></tr>

<p>And the next lesson takes the following form:</p>

<td><span lang="fr">Maintenant que vous sçavez vos lettres, apprenez vos syllables, dictes après moy.</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>After dealing with the sounds of the French language,
De la Mothe passes to more general considerations. He
touches on the much-discussed question of the reform of the
orthography, and expresses his strong disapproval of all
attempts to make it tally with the pronunciation. Then he
deals with the pronunciation of the Law French of the English,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
which he puts down to such fanciful experiments. Lawyers
write their French as they pronounce it, and pronounce it
as they write it, so that it is now quite corrupt. He next
proceeds to give his pupils a short history of the chief
Romance tongues, French, Italian, and Spanish, and finally
of the English language.</p>

<p>The remainder of the first part of the <i>Alphabet</i> is occupied by
short familiar dialogues on the usual subjects&mdash;greetings, the
weather, the divisions of time, buying and selling, and the occurrences
of daily life&mdash;as follows:</p>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">-166-</a></span>At the end of these dialogues comes the second part of
De la Mothe's book, entitled the <i>Treasure of the French Tongue</i>.
It consists of a collection of French and English proverbs and
golden sayings, "<ins title="original: deligently">diligently</ins> gathered and faithfully set in
order after the Alphabeticall manner, for those that are
desirous of the French tongue." These early teachers of
French were fond of such collections. They usually included
proverbs in their grammar books, and Palsgrave, as we have
seen, hoped to publish a separate work on them. His intention
seems to have been first fully realised by De la Mothe,
although Holyband had included a smaller list in both his
popular text-books.</p>

<p>From De la Mothe's <i>French Alphabet</i>, more than from any
other of these early works, we can form a fairly adequate idea
of the method of teaching French prevalent at the time.
Much importance was attached to pronunciation and to
reading, which were made the first subject of study. Rules
were felt to be desirable for learning the sounds, but more
stress was laid on the services of a good teacher; "for do
not think," says De la Mothe, "that my book is by itself
to make thee a good Frenchman." His own method was to
make his pupils repeat the sounds after him. He believed
that the acquirement of a good pronunciation depended on
a mastery of each separate sound in the language. According
to him, any one who can pronounce each letter correctly
must, perforce, enunciate words correctly, and on the same
plan, sentences also; a rather questionable theory this, but
we must remember that De la Mothe took for granted the
daily attendance of a French tutor. The understanding of
the language De la Mothe regards as the second stage in the
pupil's progress. This he considers a natural consequence
of a perfect command of the pronunciation and reading of the
language. Lastly comes the speaking of the language, which,
according to him, results from understanding it.</p>

<p>De la Mothe does not only expound his theories; he also
gives fairly detailed information as to how they may be put
into practice. After engaging a good teacher, the student
should learn to pronounce his letters and syllables perfectly.
Then he may begin to read, very slowly at first, at the rate
of from three to four lines a day, "or more or less according
as your capacity can reach or your patience permit." Each
word should be spelt four or five times, and in the spelling
<span class="sidenote">HIS METHOD FOR LEARNING FRENCH</span>and reading the pupil should "not let passe any letter or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">-167-</a></span>
syllable without bringing them to the trial of his rules."
When you can "read truly and pronounce perfectly,
then go about to English it." First translate the French
passages into English, with the help of the word for word
translation provided, then copy out the French into a book
provided for the purpose, close the <i>Alphabet</i> and attempt
to translate your copy into English at sight, correcting the
version by referring again to the <i>Alphabet</i>. Next proceed
to retranslate the English back into French on a similar
method. "Continue this order for a month, every day
repeating three or four times, both your letters and your
syllables, and reading and Englishing as many times your
old from the beginning till your latter lesson." ... "Being
once able to reade and pronounce perfectly with your rules,
two or three leaves of your book, at most, I can assure you
that there is not any French book though never so hard, but
you shall be able to reade it and pronounce it as truly as can
be wished. For in less than one leaf of your book, all your rules
are to be observed, three or four times at least. For there
is not a word but in it is one or two rules to be noted."</p>

<p>When the learner has thus fully mastered the rules of
pronunciation, he may go forward speedily, translating from
English into French, and from French into English, and revising
constantly. "This is the only ready way to learn to
read and pronounce, to write and speak French." Not a
single day should be allowed to pass without exercises of this
kind, and "you shall find in less than five or six weeks your
labour and dilegence afford you much profit, and advancement,
that you will wonder at it, and much greater than I dare
promise you."</p>

<p>Those who have made some progress in the language,
De la Mothe advises to make the acquaintance of some Frenchman,
if possible, "to the end that you may practice with him
by daily conference together, in speech and talk, what you
have learned. And if you be in place where the Frenchmen
have a Church for themselves, as they do in London, get you
a French Bible or a New Testament, and every day go both
to their lectures and Sermons. The one will confirm and
strengthen your pronunciation, and the other cause you to
understand when one doth speak." And, finally, if you
wish to understand the hardest and most "eloquent" French,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">-168-</a></span>and to speak it naturally, you must not neglect reading, but
provide yourself with a French Dictionary, and the hardest
book you can find, and set about translating it, on the method
already described. If the student will not take the pains to
translate the book, he should at least read it carefully, and
write out a list of the hardest words and of appropriate
phrases "to serve his turn, either to speak or write when he
has need of them."</p>

<p>Although De la Mothe makes no mention of grammar, when
he describes his method of teaching, he did not consider it
unnecessary. Indeed he declares it is not possible to speak
French perfectly without such rules, which he no doubt used
for purposes of reference, as he did the rules of pronunciation.
He even promises to produce shortly a <i>French Tutor</i>, "that
will teach you in so short and easie a way as may be, both by
the perfect knowledge of the parts of your speeches, and
syntaxe, not only to speak perfectly, but also to know if
one doth not speak well, to reprove him when he doth speak
ill, and to teach him to amend his bad speech: a thing which
yet before has never been taught. The promise is great,
but the performance shall not be less if this be acceptable
to you." Unfortunately this promise does not seem to have
been kept. That his <i>Alphabet</i> did not prove "acceptable"
cannot be the reason. Most probably De la Mothe left England
before he had time to show his gratitude to the English
nobility by the production of this second book.</p>

<p>We have seen that these teachers of French did not always
look upon each other as rivals. Bellot wrote verses in honour
of Holyband, who was a friend of Fontaine, another of the
group of French teachers in St. Paul's Churchyard. But
such friendly relations were not general. The teachers just
mentioned belonged to what formed, no doubt, the highest rank
of the profession. Bellot calls himself a "gentilhomme," and so
does Holyband; and both refer to criticism and attacks upon
them by other French teachers.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Holyband calls attention
to the unscrupulousness of many of them, who take money
in advance and do nothing to earn it; and expresses his contempt
for his critics&mdash;Frenchmen ignorant of English, Burgundians,
or Englishmen who do not know French thoroughly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">-169-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRIENDSHIPS AND RIVALRIES</span>The many French-speaking schoolmasters from the Netherlands&mdash;chiefly
Walloons and Burgundians&mdash;and the English
teachers of French formed separate groups apart from the
Huguenots. Yet another group was recruited from the ranks
of the Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>The Burgundians, who did not come from Burgundy, but
from that portion of the Netherlands which had been under
the rule of the House of Burgundy, formed a very considerable
proportion of the foreign population of London. In 1567
there were only forty-four of them in London, but by 1571
their number had risen to four hundred and twenty-four&mdash;almost
as many as the total number of French in the
city.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> The Walloons were still more numerous, and no
doubt outnumbered the French. Such instructors were an
obstacle in the way of those desirous of raising the standard
of the French taught in England. Against the peculiarities of
the French spoken in the Netherlands, Holyband is constantly
warning his pupils. "You shall know them," he says, "at
the pronunciation of <i>c</i>, as the proper mark of their language,"
for they sound it as the English <i>sh</i> or the French <i>ch</i>, saying
<i>shela</i> for <i>cela</i>.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Warnings were also given against the
barbarisms of the Picard dialect.</p>

<p>Of the many "Dutch" teachers in London&mdash;an epithet
which usually includes the Flemings and Walloons&mdash;it is
impossible to say which actually taught French.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Apparently
those who attended the French Church taught that
language; a certain Gouvert Hawmells, for example, a native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">-170-</a></span>of Antwerp, who came to England in 1568&mdash;"for religion"&mdash;is
specially mentioned as a teacher of the French language;
in 1571 he was living with his family in the house of one Thomas
Grimes in St. Margaret's parish. He attended the French
Church and was not a denizen.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Apparently his case was
not an exceptional one. What is more, there were in London
French schoolmistresses from the Low Countries. Marry
Lemaire, "by trade a French schoolmistress," was a native
of Antwerp and came to England in 1578; for over forty years
she kept school in Southwick. Another French schoolmistress,
Anness Deger, born in Tournay, came to England some ten
years earlier, and in 1618 was still practising her "trade"
in Tenter Abbey. Her qualifications were not of the first
order; in the Register of Aliens she was unable to sign her
name, for which she substituted a cross. There was also
a "goodwife Frances schoolmistress, in Popinjay Alley,"
mentioned in 1598 and 1599, but whether she taught French
or not is not specified.</p>

<p>Although the chief French teachers who were responsible
for the manuals of the second half of the sixteenth century
were Huguenots, it is extremely probable that Roman
Catholic teachers were in the majority. When a census of
the foreigners dwelling in London was taken in 1563, only
712 out of a total of 4534 had come to England on religious
grounds.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Naturally the proportion of Protestants greatly
increased as the persecutions grew more severe, until the
passing of the Edict of Nantes in their favour in 1598. Then
it probably again decreased; in the time of Charles I. there
were at least five French papists to one French Protestant.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
These Roman Catholic teachers were as a matter of course
regarded as suspect by those in authority, and Jesuit priests
teaching in noble English families, or those conversant with
them, were carefully watched.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The suspicions aroused by
the John Love who had a French school in St. Paul's
Churchyard have already been noticed. This feeling became
particularly strong after the Gunpowder Plot (1605). In the
"Constitutions, Laws, Statutes, Decrees and Ordinances" of
the Bury St. Edmunds Town Council of 1607 an article was
inserted "to prevent the infectinge of youth in Poperie by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">-171-</a></span>Schoolmasters."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> <span class="sidenote">CLASSES OF FRENCH TEACHERS</span>The constables of every ward in the
borough had to certify the Aldermen, Recorder, and Justices
of the Peace, of the names of all persons "that do keep any
school for the teaching of youth to write, read, or understand
the English, Latin, French, Italian and Spanish
Tongues, upon pain to forfeit for every default 6s. 8d." This
notification had to be made quarterly. Others than the
master or usher of the free grammar school, wishing to teach
any of these languages, had to obtain special licence; and
any one sending his children to a school kept by a teacher
who had no licence was liable to forfeit for every week the
sum of 6s. 8d.</p>

<p>Fear of proselytism was not the only incentive which
aroused the animosity of certain sections of the English public.
Many young Englishmen received much of their education
from French tutors, frequently refugees, who taught them
the usual subjects as well as French. One objection raised
against them was that they corrupted their pupils' English
if they spoke and wrote English themselves, as they did almost
without exception. Thus they "pul downe with one hand
more than they can build with the other," wrote Th. Morrice
in 1619.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Such complaints, however, cannot have been very
general or have had much effect on the lot of French teachers.</p>

<p>A further attack was to come from another quarter. In
the early years of the sixteenth century, as in the Middle
Ages, Englishmen had held an important place in the French
teaching profession. They had been called to important positions
as tutors, and had written grammars of the language.
After the appearance of Palsgrave's Grammar, however, we hear
no more of these English teachers of French, driven into the
background, no doubt, by the great invasion of French teachers.
Probably Duwes's earlier attack had helped either to turn
public favour from the native teachers or to discourage them.
Holyband, too, had endorsed the opinion of Duwes somewhat
later, and expressed the little importance he attached to their
criticisms. To acquire the true French pronunciation and
idiom, he declares, it is necessary to learn from a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century, however, an
English teacher of French came forward, and energetically
took up the defence of his fellow-teachers of English birth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">-172-</a></span>This was John Eliote, a man of boisterous spirits and a lover
of good wine&mdash;a taste which he had acquired in France, where
he had lived many years. There, if the dialogue he wrote
for the help of students of French may be taken as autobiographical,
he had spent three years in the College of Montagu
at Paris, taught for a year in the Collège des Africains at
Orleans, lived for ten months at Lyons, and spent a year
amongst the Benedictine monks. On the murder of Henri III.
in 1589, Eliote returned to England, strongly imbued with
a love for the country in which he had lived so long.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Surely for my part," he writes, "France I love well, Frenchmen I
hate not, and unto you I sweare by S. Scobe cap de Gascongne, that I love
a cup of new Gascon or old Orleans wine, as well as the best French of you
all. Which love, you must know, was engendered in the sweet soile of
Fraunce, where I paissed like a bon companion, with a steele at my girdle,
till the Friars (a canker of the cursed Convent) fell to drawing of naked
knives, and kild indeed the good King Henrie of France, the more the
pitye. Since which time I retired myself among the merrie muses, and
by the worke of my pen and inke, have dezinkhornifistibulated a fantasticall
Rapsody of dialoguisme, to the end that I would not be found an idle drone
among so many famous teachers and professors of noble languages, who are
very busy daily in devising and setting forth new bookes &amp; instructing our
English gentry in this honourable citie of London."</p></div>

<p>This "fantasticall rapsody" was published in 1593, and
entitled the <i>Ortho-Epia Gallica. Eliot's Fruits for the French
enriched with a double new invention, which teacheth to speake
truly, speedily, voluably the French tongue. Pend for the
practice, pleasure and profit of all English gentlemen, who will
endevour by their owne paine, study, and diligence, to attain
the naturall accent, the true pronunciation and swift and glib
Grace of this noble, famous and courtly Language.</i><a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>It was dedicated to the young Sir Robert Dudley,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> son of
the famous Earl of Leicester, whom Eliote possibly instructed
in the French tongue. Eliote had taken up the teaching of
French, "that most ticklish of all tongues," on his return to
England, and in his book he speaks of his long practice in
learning and teaching the language. He proceeds, in the
first place, to make fun of the "learned Professors of the
French Tongue in the city of London." He burlesques the
dedicatory epistles of his predecessors, especially that of
Bellot,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and declares he is fully aware that, to be in the fashion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">-173-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">ENGLISH TEACHERS OF FRENCH</span>he ought to "dilate in some good speeches of the dignitie of
the French tongue, and then show what ease this book of
mine shall bring to the learning of the French, more than other
bookes have done heretofore." But he must first ask pardon
for his presumption in writing on this subject.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Do no blame me," he says, addressing the "gentle doctors of Gaule,"
as he called them, "if because I would not be found a loyterer in mine
own countrie, amongst so many virtuously occupied, I have put my pen
to paper: if I have bene busie, labourd, sweat, dropt, studied, devised,
fought, bought, borrowed, turned, translated, mined, fined, refined, interlined,
glossed, composed, and taken intollerable toil to shew an easie entrance
and introduction to my deare countrimen, in your curious and courtesan
French tongue, to the end to advance them as much as may bee, in the
knowledge of all virtuous and noble qualities, to the which they are all
naturally adicted."</p></div>

<p>He is quite ready to have his book criticised as the work
of an Englishman, and challenges these "gentle doctors"
"to be ready quickly to cavill at his booke."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I beseech you," he continues, "heartily calumniate my doings with
speede, I request you humbly controll my method as soone as you may, I
earnestly entreat you hisse at my inventions, I desire you to peruse my
periodicall punctuations, find fault with my pricks, nicks, and tricks, prove
them not worth a pin, not a point, not a pish: argue me a fond, foolish,
frivolous, and phantasicall author, and persuade every one that you meet,
that my booke is a false, fained, slight, confused, absurd, barbarous, lame,
imperfect, single, uncertaine, childish, piece of work, and not able to teach
and why so? Forsooth because it is not your owne but an Englishman's
doing. Faile you not to do so, if you love me, and would have me do the
like for you another time."</p></div>

<p>While admitting that there may be a few good French
teachers amongst the refugees, he outlines a picture of the
ordinary type which is far from flattering; and we gather
that he had himself studied French with several refugees.
He implies that the French teachers receive money in advance,
and then do nothing else but "take their eases and, as the
renowned poet saith,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="fr"><span class="i0">Saulter, dancer, faire les tours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boire vin blanc et vermeil,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Que conter escuz au soleil.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Mercurie the god of Cunning, and Dis the Father of French
crowns are their deities." They care nothing for the progress
of their scholars; all they do is to give them a short lesson of
half an hour, in which they read and construe about half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">-174-</a></span>
page of French. They are equally indifferent to the troubled
state of their country, provided they themselves are comfortable
and well provided with French wines.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Messires, what newes from France, can you tell?" he asks them, "still
warres, warres. A heavy hearing truly, yet if you be in good health, have
many scholars, get good store of crowns, and drink good wine, I doubt not
but you shall do well, and I desire the good God of Heaven to continue it
so still. Have they had a fruitful vintage in France this year, or no? me
thinks our Bordeaux wines are very deare, and in good faith I am very
sorry for it. But they will be at a more reasonable reckoning, if these
same loftie Leaguers would once crouch and come to some good composition
... that we may safely fetch their deifying liquer, which dieth
quickly our flegmaticke faces into a pure sanguine complexion."</p></div>

<p>The style of the introduction is maintained throughout the
rest of the book. Eliote says he wrote the whole "in a merrie
phantasicall vaine to confirme and stir up the wit and memorie
of the learner," and "diversified it with a varietie of stories
no lesse authenticall than the devices of Lucian's dialogues."
He admits that he had turned over some French authors, and
where he "espied any pretie example that might quicken the
capacitie of the learner," he "presumed to make a peece of
it flie this way, to set together the frame of (his) fantasticall
comedie ... and out of every one (he) had some share for
the better ornament of (his) worke." Eliote was well
acquainted with French literature. He considered Marot the
best poet, and gave Ronsard the second place only. He also
read Du Bartas, Belleau, Desportes, and other sixteenth-century
writers. But most of his admiration was reserved
for Rabelais, "that merrie grig," and it is clear that he
modelled his style on that of the great French humorist.
Like Rabelais, he occasionally affects a sort of gibberish,
coins words, and, like him also, he strings words together and
is fond of exaggeration. Numerous passages in the <i>Ortho-Epia
Gallica</i> are reminiscent of famous incidents in <i>Gargantua</i> and
<i>Pantagruel</i>. Like Panurge, he defends debts and debtors:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Quoy! Debtes! O chose rare et antiquaire. Il n'est bon chrestien
qui ne doibt rien," and, in the style of Rabelais, he assures us that his book
contains "profound and deep mysteries, ... and very worthie the reading,
and such as I thinke you have not had performed in any other book that
is yet extant.... Doest thou see what a sea, what a gulfe there is? Thou
hadst need of Theseus' thread to guide thee out of that Labyrinth."</p></div>

<p>The <i>Ortho-Epia Gallica</i> forms a striking contrast to Palsgrave's
rather austere <i>Esclarcissement</i>, the last work on the
<span class="sidenote">JOHN ELIOTE</span>French language composed by an Englishman before that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">-175-</a></span>
Eliote. The dialogues occupy nearly the whole volume. The
first few pages, however, contain a table of French sounds
with their pseudo-English equivalents. The pronunciation
was, in Eliote's opinion, one of the chief difficulties of this
difficult language, "deemed a jewel, so dearly bought, and
so much desired by all"; and he considered that, with the
help of Ramus and Peletier for the pronunciation, he had
succeeded in reducing "the gulf of difficulties into a small
stream" by "sounding the French by our English alphabet."</p>

<p>He arranges his dialogues, which he calls <i>Le parlement
de Babillards, id est, The Parlaiment of Prattlers</i>, into three
groups. The first of these consists of three long dialogues
on the method of learning foreign languages, on the excellence
of writers in both ancient and modern tongues, and on travel
through the chief towns of Europe. The first dialogue ends
with the quotation from Du Bartas in praise of Queen
Elizabeth and her accomplishments, accompanied by a translation
in English verse by Eliote himself.</p>

<p>The second part, styled "<i>M. Eliote's first booke</i>," is
of a much more elementary character than the one just
described. Eliote had referred elsewhere to a work entitled
<i>The Scholler</i>, in which he propounded a "general method of
learning and teaching all languages contrived by nature and
art, conformable to the precepts of Aristotle." This, or part
of it, evidently formed the first part of the <i>Ortho-Epia Gallica</i>,
where it is separately paged.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>In his first and second books, which thus form the second
and third parts of the work, he expounds "his double
new invention, which teacheth Englishmen to speake truly,
speedily and volubly the French tong." The first part of
this "invention" consists in placing by the side of the French
and English a third column, giving the French in pseudo-English
equivalents&mdash;"the true pronunciation of each word
wholly and certain little stripes (called approches) between
the sillables that are to be spoken roundly and glib in one
breath." The twelve dialogues of Eliote's first book are
fairly simple in character, and some of them were probably
suggested by Vives's <i>Exercitatio</i>. Their subject matter does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">-176-</a></span>not differ much from earlier dialogues, but their treatment is
decidedly original. The following quotation is taken from
the first dialogue:</p>

<div class="table">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Eliote's dialogue">
<tr><td><span lang="fr">Hau Garcon dors tu vilain? debout, debout, ie te reveilleray tantost avec un bon baton.</span></td>
<td>Ho Garssoon dortu veelein? deboo, deboo, ie te reue-lheré tant-tot tavec-keun boon batoon.</td>
<td>What boy slepeth thou villain? up, up, I shall shall wake thee soon with a good cudgell.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span lang="fr">Je me leve, monsieur.</span></td>
<td>Ie me léveh moonseewr.</td>
<td>I rise sir.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span lang="fr">Quelle heure est-il?</span></td>
<td><ins title="original: Qe">Qel</ins>-heur et-til?</td>
<td>What o'clock is it?</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="fr">Il est six heures.</span></td>
<td>Il-é see-zewres.</td>
<td>It is six o'clock.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="fr">Donnez moy mes chausses de velours verd.</span></td>
<td>Donné moe' mes shosséh de veloor vert.</td>
<td>Give me my my green velvet breeches.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span lang="fr">Lesquelles?</span></td>
<td>Le-keles?</td>
<td>Which?</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="fr">C'est tout un; mes chausses rondes de satin rouge. . . .</span></td>
<td>Set-toot-tewn; mes shosseh roondeh de satin rouge. . . .</td>
<td>It is all one; my round red satin ones, etc.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noi">There are twelve dialogues in all, but only each alternate one
is accompanied by this curious guide to pronunciation.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>In the second book and third part the dialogues are longer
and more numerous, dealing with the different trades and
occupations&mdash;"les devis familiers des mesters fort delectables
a lyre." They do not, however, confine themselves to the
characters usually introduced into similar dialogues; besides
the mercer, the draper, the shoemaker, the innkeeper, and so
on, we have the armourer, the robber, the debtor, the apothecary,
and other characters which offer ample scope for treatment
in the Rabelaisian vein, of which Eliote was so fond.
Some suggest that Eliote was acquainted with Holyband's
works. This book contains the second part of his "double
new invention." The French and English are printed on
opposite pages, and in the margin the sounds of the most
difficult French letters are indicated, thus:</p>

<blockquote class="interlinear">
<div><div><i>ai</i> sound <i>e</i></div>
<div><i>ay</i> sound <i>e</i></div></div>
<div><div><i>am</i> sound <i>ein</i></div>
<div><i>aine</i> sound <i>eineh</i>, and so on.</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="noi">This table he describes "as Mercurie's finger to direct thee
in thy progress of learning," and he repeats it on the margin
of every pair of opposite pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">-177-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">THE "ORTHO-EPIA GALLICA"</span>

After these twenty dialogues comes the "Conclusion of
the parlaiment of prattlers," which depicts a group of friends
walking by the Thames and St. Paul's, "prattling, chatting,
and babbling." The arrangement is the same as in the
previous dialogues, and the work closes with a quotation
from Du Bartas's praise of France:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="fr"><span class="i0">O mille et mille fois terre heureuse et féconde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O perle de l'Europe! O Paradis du monde!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">France je te salue, O mère des guerriers.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his dialogue called <i>The Scholar</i>, incorporated in the
first part of the <i>Ortho-Epia</i>, Eliote explains his 'new' method
of learning languages, by nature and art. By "nature" he
means the acquirement of a vocabulary of all created things,
by use and common practice; and by "art" the rules and
precepts for combining these into sentences, and also the
authority of learned men. Such rules chiefly concern nouns,
verbs, and pronunciation, "in which the greatest mystery
of all languages consists." Thus, although he gives no
grammatical information in his <i>Ortho-Epia Gallica</i>, he recognized
its importance.</p>

<p>Before introducing his pupils to the method of "Nature
and Art," Eliote would have them well grounded in nouns and
verbs, and able to translate dialogues, comedies in verse, and
prose writings. He attached much importance to translation
from English into French, just as Palsgrave did. He directs
the student to make out the meaning of the French first by
comparing it with the English column, and then to cover over
the French version, and attempt to translate the English into
French. "This I have learned by long experience to be the
readiest way to attaine the knowledge of any language, that
we of Englishmen make French, and not of French learn
English." As to the theory of "Nature and Art," it seems
to have been little more than the method, common at the
time, of making practice the basis of the study of French,
and confirming this by rules as need for them arose.</p>

<p>In addition to the <i>Ortho-Epia Gallica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Eliote also wrote a
<i>Survey or topographical description of France</i>, collected from
sundry approved authors. This was published in 1592, and
dedicated to Sir John Pickering, Keeper of the Privy Seal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">-178-</a></span>He also translated from French into English<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> a number of
unimportant works, mostly of topical interest, one of them
being dedicated to Robert, Earl of Essex. Little else is
known of him, except that he was born in Warwickshire in
1562, and entered Brasenose College, Oxford, on the 12th of
December 1580, at the age of eighteen years.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> He tells us
that he held the degree of Doctor of Divinity, but there is no
record of his having taken any such degree there. Robert
Greene was among his friends, and he wrote a sonnet in
questionable French on Greene's <i>Perimedes or the Black Smith</i>,
with which it was published in 1588. These are all the details
we possess concerning this amusing and striking figure among
the French teachers of the sixteenth century.</p>

opening for the teaching of any of the Germanic languages in England at this early
time, when they were only learnt in exceptional cases. There were no doubt a few such
teachers, here and there. We are told that in London "there be also teachers and
professors of the Holy or Hebrew language, of the Caldean, Syriack or Arabicke or
Tartary Languages, of the Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch and Polish Tongues. And
here be they which can speake the Persian and the Morisco, and the Turkish and the

nations. And in divers other languages fit for Ambassadors and Orators, and Agents

The earliest work for teaching Dutch to Englishmen was probably the <i>Dutch Tutor</i>
of 1660; cp. F. Watson, <i>Modern Subjects</i>, ch. xv. John Minsheu taught a number
of languages in London, and wrote a <i>Ductor in Linguas</i> (1617), in eleven languages.</p></div>

<h3>METHODS OF TEACHING FRENCH&mdash;LATIN AND FRENCH&mdash;FRENCH
AND ENGLISH DICTIONARIES&mdash;STUDY OF FRENCH
LITERATURE</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Eliote</span> gives some information concerning the fees charged
by French teachers in the later part of the sixteenth century.
He asserts that the usual charge was a shilling a week,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> but
we are left in doubt as to how many lessons this entitled the
student to. He affirms, probably not seriously, that he would
charge a gentleman £10 a year, and a lord from £20 to £30.</p>

<p>We are indebted to him also for an account, very prejudiced,
no doubt, of the usual method employed by French
teachers generally. This consisted, according to him, in reading
a page of French and then translating it. Fortunately we
are enabled, by means of the French text-books that have
come down to us, to draw a fuller picture of the French lessons
of the time. It has been seen that as a rule these books contained
four parts&mdash;rules of pronunciation, rules of grammar,
reading exercises, and a vocabulary. They are generally
written throughout in French and English (in parallel columns<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>),
the reason of this being the importance attached to reading
and to double translation, from French into English and English
into French. In the English version the idiomatic phrase is
sacrificed in order to give a more literal rendering of the French,
and also, possibly, because these Frenchmen were incapable
of writing any other. As is to be expected, translation from
French into English was the more usual exercise. Translation
from English into French, however, was by no means
neglected, and appears to have been recommended principally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">-180-</a></span>by English teachers of French, and more especially by Palsgrave
and Eliote. Edward VI.'s French exercises, it will be
remembered, are translations from English into French, or free
composition in French.</p>

<p>In addition to reading and translating, much importance
was attached to pronunciation. It was generally considered
best to learn the sounds of the language by repetition after
a teacher with a good accent; but rules were thought necessary
to confirm the knowledge thus acquired. As to rules of
grammar, there was no question of learning the language by
means of them. A grammar was treated as a book of reference,
just as a dictionary. Thus the student usually learnt
the pronunciation by reading the French aloud with his tutor,
referring to the rules of pronunciation whenever necessary,
and then translating and retranslating the dialogues, grammar
being supplied as the need for it was felt. Although these
early teachers strictly limited the place of grammar, they
almost all agree in emphasizing its importance within the limits
indicated. Grammar rules were reduced to a minimum.
Attention was called to what were considered important
general rules, but those with numerous exceptions, it is argued,
were better learnt by "use" and persistent reading, "so as
not to weary with long discourses which would be necessary
to explain things learnt better by practice than by rule."</p>

<p>The dialogue form in which almost all the reading material
is given, and the proverbs and familiar phrases, show the importance
attached to a practical and colloquial knowledge of
the language. The teaching of French was of a decidedly
business-like nature, and closely in touch with the concerns
of life. One of the chief reasons for this, no doubt, was that it
was learnt for social or other immediate requirements. The
fact that French was not taught in the grammar schools
undoubtedly assisted it to maintain its close connexion with
practical life. It is only about a century and a half later,
when French began to gain a foothold in these schools, that
it was taught more and more on grammatical lines, and less
and less as a living language.</p>

<p>Latin, although most of the school statutes of the time
encourage the scholars to speak it, was taught chiefly on
grammatical lines.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> The memorizing of Latin grammar was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">-181-</a></span>a foremost subject even in the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
<span class="sidenote">LATIN AND FRENCH</span>In the sixteenth
century the Latin grammar usually known as Lily's was the
prescribed national grammar, with rules of accidence in
English and of syntax in Latin.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Familiar dialogues in
the style of those for French were also used, the chief difference
between the Latin and French dialogues being that the
Latin are separate and complete works in themselves, and are
not, as a rule, provided with an English translation. They
were memorized as the grammar was. From the dialogues, or
colloquies as they were called, dealing with typical occurrences
of life, the Latin scholar passed on to the reading of school
authors&mdash;Cato, Cicero, Ovid, Virgil, Terence, etc.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Nor was
vocabulary neglected, for in the schools of the Renaissance
the practice of learning so many words a day, prevalent in
the Middle Ages, was still in vogue.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the books generally used in teaching
Latin were not without some influence in determining the types
of manuals employed for teaching French. The practice of
including religious formulae, which we find in some books,
was sanctioned by their place in the national Latin grammar,
while it is clear that the Latin colloquia of the time had
considerable influence on the French dialogues. In the early
sixteenth century the dialogues of the scholar Vives,<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> who
received honours at both Oxford and Cambridge during his
short stay in England, were much in vogue. Like the French
dialogues of the time, they kept closely in touch with the
interests of the pupils and dealt with such topics as rising
in the morning, going to school, returning home, and
children's play and meals, and students' chatter. Similar
works were the <i>Sententiae pueriles</i>,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> a book for beginners, first
published at Leipzig in 1544, and containing a collection of
familiar phrases rather than dialogues, and the <i>Pueriles Confabulatiunculae</i>
by Evaldus Gallus. In the second half of
the sixteenth century two other manuals of conversation
were added to those already in use in England: the <i>Colloquia</i>
of Mathurin Cordier, first published in Latin in 1564, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">-182-</a></span>Castellion's <i>Sacred Dialogues</i> based on the Scriptures, printed
in Latin at Basle, in 1555.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>With the text-books, however, all close resemblance
between the teaching of Latin in grammar schools and the
teaching of French ends. As we have seen, reading, pronunciation,
and conversation were the main concerns of the
French student; translation held a large place and grammar
rules a subsidiary one. The grammar-school boy, on the
contrary, would first gain an elementary knowledge from
rules written in English, and memorize the vocabulary
and phrases; learn his Latin grammar, and then parse
and construe<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> the usual school authors.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The sons of the
aristocracy and well-to-do classes probably learnt by a more
practical method, as they were able to have private tutors,
who devoted all their time to providing the necessary
atmosphere. As late as 1607, when Latin was less used
colloquially, the writer Cleland, a great advocate of the
teaching of French, condemns the practice of those parents
who have their children brought up to speak Latin only;
they neglect their mother tongue and the language of
elegance, French, and soon forget their Latin when once
removed from their tutor's care.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> That such cases were the
exception rather than the rule, even in the early sixteenth century,
may be gathered from the two great educational writers
of the time, Sir Thomas Elyot and Roger Ascham. Both
the <i>Governour</i> (1531) and the <i>Scholemaster</i> are protests against
the common school usage of placing grammar in the first
place, and a summons to base the study of the language on the
reading of authors. They believed with Quintilian that
"Longum et difficile iter est per praecepta, breve et efficax
per exempla." Colet in his <i>Aeditio</i> had laid down the same
principle, to the effect that the "reading of good books, dyligent
information of taught masters, studious advertence and taking
heed of learners, hearing eloquent men speak, and finally
busy imitation with the tongue and pen, more availeth shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">-183-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">GRAMMAR AND TRANSLATION</span>to get the true eloquent speech than all the tradition of rule
and precepts of masters"; and he adds, "men spoke not
Latin because such rules were made, but contrariwise because
men spoke such Latin, upon that followed the rules and so
were made."<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Yet it seems that the force of tradition prevailed,
and that these precepts were only put into practice
in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>It is striking to notice how close was the resemblance
between the actual methods used by French teachers and
those advocated by would-be reformers of the teaching of
Latin. Colet's words express almost exactly the sentiments
and practice of Holyband, De la Mothe, and other French
teachers; and the same is true of Elyot and Ascham. "Nothing
can be more convenient," writes Elyot in referring to students
of Latin, "than by little and little to train and exercise them
in the speaking of Latin, informing them to know first the
names in Latin of all the things that come in sight, and to
name all the parts of their bodies, and giving them somewhat
that they covert or desire in most gentle manner to teach
them to ask it again in Latin." He even goes so far as to
say that the pupil may "as sone speake good latin" on this
method "as he may do pure frenche,"<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> thereby showing that
he probably derived suggestions from the prevalent methods
of teaching French. Elyot, however, realized that the use
of Latin as a familiar tongue was not as practicable in schools
as in many noble families, where it might well happen that
the pupil would have "none other persons to serve him
or keep hym company but suche as can speake Latine
elegantly." How successful the sole use of Latin could be in
such circumstances is exemplified in the well-known case of
Montaigne. Ascham, like Elyot, recognized the exceptional
conditions required for such a method. He believed the
"dailie use of speaking" would be the best way of learning
the language if the child could only hear it spoken perfectly,
but failing this he considered the practice dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> It
is probable, however, that in the best French schools, and
certainly in that of Holyband, this ideal was realized in the
case of French.</p>

<p>As regards the respective importance of reading and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">-184-</a></span>grammar, the French teachers of the time appear to have put
into practice the ideas of the reformers. All agree that
grammar rules should be as few as possible, and be taught
in connexion with reading. The general method of French
teachers was to refer to the rule as the need for it arose in
reading. Ascham also pleads for the study of grammar, "so
hardlie learned by the scholar in all common scholes," along
with authors; and the educational reformer Mulcaster, in his
<i>Elementarie</i> of 1582, writes that grammar is best learnt by
being applied to the matter, and that the child's mind should
not be clogged with rules. Elyot differs slightly from them
in detail but not in principle. He allows grammar to
precede the study of authors, provided it is reduced to the
smallest possible amount. "Grammar," he says, "being but
an introduction to the study of authors," care should be
taken "not to detain the child too longe in that tedious
labour, for a gentyll wytte is there with some fatigate," and
"hit in a maner mortifieth his corage" before he "cometh
to the most swete and pleasant readinge of olde authors."<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
Both these views as regards grammar&mdash;that of Ascham and
Mulcaster, and that of Elyot&mdash;were prevalent among French
teachers of the time. There are only small differences in
detail; the general principles are identical.</p>

<p>In the matter of translation, "most common and most
commendable of all other exercises of youth,"<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> there is a
striking resemblance between the method of double translation
common among French teachers, and the same method set out
by Ascham, who marks the transition from oral to written
methods of teaching Latin.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> In the case of De la Mothe, the
resemblance is so clear and close that we are led to believe
he was acquainted with the work of Elizabeth's tutor,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> published
in 1570, over twenty years before the <i>French Alphabet</i>.
Ascham's system consisted of the double translation of a
model book, and it is interesting to compare it with the
method of De la Mothe. The pupil has first to parse and
translate the Latin into English; "after this the child must
take a paper booke, and sitting in some place where no man
shall prompe him, by him self, let him translate into Englisshe
his former lesson. Then showing it to his master, let the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">-185-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">BOOKS IN FRENCH AND ENGLISH</span>master take from him his Latin booke, and pausing an houre,
at the least, than let the childe translate his owne Englishe
into latin againe, in an other paper booke." And when this
is done, the master should compare it with the original Latin,
"and laie them both togither."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>There was thus much in common between the teaching of
Latin and the teaching of French. The dialogues, which
form so important a feature in the French text-books of
the time, were certainly indebted to the Latin Colloquia,
although they also continue the tradition of the mediaeval
French conversation-books. The Latin Dialogues of Vives
had much influence on the French, and Holyband based
one of his books, the <i>Campo di Fior</i>, on the <i>Exercitatio</i> translated
in French, Italian, and English. Eliote also acknowledged
his debt to the Spanish scholar. In other cases the
debt was almost inevitable and probably unconscious; for
the French teachers, who often taught Latin as well, would
use such books daily, and had moreover probably acquired
their own knowledge of Latin from them. Holyband, we
have seen, read the <i>Sententiae pueriles</i> with his pupils.</p>

<p>The importance attached to reading and double translation
by teachers of French led to the appearance of a great
number of books in French and English, on the lines of
Bellot's <i>Jardin de Vertu</i>. For instance, part of the <i>Semaines</i>
of Du Bartas, the most popular French poet in England
in the sixteenth century, was published in this form in
1596, and again in 1625, on the occasion of the marriage
of Charles I. This translation is due to William L'Isle of
Wilbraham,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> the pioneer in the study of Anglo-Saxon, who
dedicated it in the first place to Lord Howard of Effingham,
Earl of Nottingham, Lord Admiral, and subsequently to
Charles I. It is entitled <i>Part of Du Bartas, English and
French, and in his own kinde of verse, so near the French
Englished, as may teach Englishmen French, or a Frenchman
English. Sequitur Victoria Junctos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> and consists of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">-186-</a></span>first two days of the <i>Second Week</i>, with the French and
English arranged on opposite pages, followed by an English
translation of the commentary of Simon Goulart de Senlis.</p>

<p>Guy du Faur, Sieur de Pibrac, was another French writer
widely read in England, and his <i>Quatrains</i> were frequently
commended by French teachers to their scholars. They were
translated into English verse by Sylvester, the translator
of Du Bartas, and published with the French original in
1605. Sylvester dedicated the quatrains to Prince Henry,
and the copy in the British Museum contains an epigram in
English in the handwriting of his brother, afterwards Charles I.,
and a manuscript dedication to the younger prince in that of
the translator.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> The quatrains appeared again with the
subsequent editions of Sylvester's works. About this time
Prince Henry made Sylvester a Groom of his Chamber, and
gave him a small pension of £20 a year.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The story goes that
the prince valued him so highly that he made him his first
"poet pensioner," and it seems that Sylvester took advantage
of his position to encourage his royal patron's French studies.
Many other works of the kind appeared in French and in
English.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> The educational writer Charles Hoole tells us
that masters frequently taught languages by using interlinearies,
"not to speak of their construing the French
and Spanish Bible by the help of an English one."<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Lord
Herbert of Cherbury, philosopher and gallant, ambassador
in France in the time of James I., learnt French, Italian,
and Spanish, on this translation method, whilst living in
the University or at home. He mastered them, he assures
us, without the help of a tutor, solely by means of Latin
or English books translated into those languages, and of
dictionaries.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>De la Mothe advised his advanced pupils to read difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">-187-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH AND ENGLISH DICTIONARIES</span>French books with the help of a dictionary, and there
was some supply of works of this kind at the disposal
of Lord Herbert and other students of the language. It
is true that the widespread use of books in both languages
diminished the demand for such manuals, which may not have
been easy to acquire. Yet there was a considerable choice
of such works. Holyband had produced two French-English
dictionaries, in 1580 and 1593 respectively, in which he
referred to "those which broke the ice before him." There
had appeared in 1571 an anonymous <i>Dictionarie Frenche and
English</i>,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> printed by Henry Bynneman for Lucas Harrison.
This work, which does not confine itself to words only, but
includes phrases as well, was no doubt known to Holyband.
Its author had probably drawn largely on an earlier
dictionary, already mentioned, in which a place was given
to French&mdash;the Latin, English, and French Dictionary of
John Veron (1552). The inclusion of French in such a work
is a striking testimony to the importance of French at that
time. But when a second edition of Veron's dictionary was
prepared by Ralph Waddington, in 1575, he "of purpose
thought good to leave out the French, both because (he) saw
it was not necessary for English students of Latin, as for that
Maister Barret hath five years since set forth an alvearie
sufficient to instruct those which are desirous to travel in
th'understanding of the French Tongue."</p>

<p>This "alvearie" appeared in 1573, two years after the
French-English dictionary printed for Harrison. It was
entitled "<i>An alvearie or Triple Dictionarie in English, Latin
and French, very profitable for all such as be desirous of any of
those three languages ...</i>" and was dedicated to Wm. Cecil,
Lord Burghley, then Chancellor of Cambridge University.
Baret had been teaching at Cambridge for eighteen years
"pupils studious of the Latin tongue," and part of their daily
task was to translate some piece of English into Latin "for
the more speed and easie attayning of the same." At last,
"perceiving what great trouble it was to come runnying to
(him) for every word they missed,"<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> he made them collect
each day a number of Latin words and phrases, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">-188-</a></span>with their English equivalents. Within a year or two they
had gathered together a great volume of work, to which, "for
the apt similitude between the good scholers and diligent bees
in gathering them wax and honey into their hive," Baret gave
the title of <i>Alvearie</i>. At first he had no intention of publishing
the work, but when he went to London he was finally
persuaded to do so, and received help from many of his old
pupils who were then at the Inns of Court, and from several
of the best scholars in various English schools. How Baret
first thought of adding French to his dictionary is not known.
He owns that he did not trust his own skill in this matter,
although he had formerly "travelled in divers countries beyond
the seas both for languages and for learning"; but
that he "used the help of M. Chaloner and M. Claudius."
By 'M. Claudius,' Baret possibly meant Holyband, who was
often called "Maistre Claude." M. Chaloner may have been
the author of the French-English dictionary published by
Harrison in 1571.</p>

<p>According to the custom of the time, Baret's dictionary
was preceded by a number of commendatory addresses, one
of which was by the head-master of Merchant Taylors'
School, Richard Mulcaster. In the dictionary itself, every
English word is first explained, and then its equivalent
in Latin and French given. At the end are tables of the
Latin and French words "placed after the order of the
alphabet, whatsoever are to be found in any other dictionarie.
And so as to turn them backwards againe into Englishe when
they reade any Latin or French authors and doubt of any
harde worde therein."</p>

<p>Baret had "gone to God in Heavenlie seates" before the
close of 1580, when there appeared a posthumous second
edition of the <i>Alvearie</i>. In this final form Greek has a place
by the side of the other languages, and the title runs, <i>An
Alvearie or quadruple Dictionarie containing four sundrie
tongues, namely, English, Latine, Greeke, and Frenche, newlie
enriched with varietie of wordes, phrases, proverbs, and divers
lightsome observations of grammar</i>. But there is no table of
the Greek words, as for the Latin and French. Such was
the third dictionary of French words which appeared before
Holyband's.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">-189-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH IN LATIN DICTIONARIES</span>

The place given to French in these early Latin dictionaries
is worthy of notice. No doubt French first entered the
schools in this indirect way. Both Veron's and Baret's
works were used in schools; and Baret's dictionary is included
in the list of books mentioned by Charles Hoole as being
specially useful to schoolboys.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> There are at least two
other school vocabularies in which French was introduced,
both due to the poet and compiler John Higgins, who is
said to have been "well read in classick authors, and
withall very well skilled in French."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The first of his lexicographical
works was a new and revised edition of
<i>Huloet's Dictionarie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> which occupied him two years. It
appeared in 1572,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> a year before Baret's work. Higgins calls
himself "late student in Oxforde," and dedicates the volume
to Sir John Peckham. This edition by Higgins is so much
altered that it is almost a new work. One of the chief changes
was the addition of a French version to the Latin and English,
"by whiche you may finde the Latin or French of anye
Englishe woorde you will." For the French, Higgins seems
to have drawn chiefly on the Latin-French dictionary of
Robert Estienne, which had already been published in French,
English, and Latin by Jean Veron, in 1552. Higgins also
acknowledges his debt to Thierry, whose French-Latin dictionary
appeared twelve years later in 1564. There was a
close relationship between French-Latin and French-English
dictionaries. French is first found side by side with English,
in one of these French-Latin dictionaries&mdash;that of Veron;
and in subsequent years the French-English dictionaries are
mostly based on one or other of the French-Latin lexicons.
Those due to Robert Éstienne and to Thierry were probably
the sources from which the author of the French-English
dictionary of 1571 drew his material; while Holyband based
his <i>Treasurie</i> (1580), and his Dictionary (1593), respectively,
on the augmented editions of Thierry's work due to Nicot,
which appeared in 1573 and 1584.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>The second lexicographical work of Higgins, published in
1585, was a translation, entitled <i>Nomenclator or Remembrancer
of Adrianus Junius, Physician, divided into two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">-190-</a></span>tomes</i>. It professed to supply the appropriate names and
apt terms for all things under their convenient titles, in
Latin, Greek, French, and English.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> The English column
was added by Higgins.</p>

<p>Thus by the end of the sixteenth century there had
appeared in England three French-English dictionaries, and
several others in which French found a place by the side of
the classical languages. And we may add to these the
French-Latin dictionaries on which they were usually based,
for it seems extremely likely that those students of French
who knew Latin&mdash;and practically all of them would know
this chief and first of school subjects&mdash;used the French-Latin
lexicons as well, in their study of French, when other means
were not available.</p>

<p>Early in the seventeenth century, in 1611, Holyband's
French dictionary of 1593 was succeeded by the celebrated
French-English dictionary of Randle Cotgrave,<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> which occupies
in the seventeenth century the place that Palsgrave's
<i>Esclarcissement</i> does in the sixteenth among the works on the
French language produced in England. Although Cotgrave's
work is on a much larger scale than Holyband's, and much
superior to it,<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> there is a close connexion between the two.
In the <i>Stationers' Register</i> Cotgrave's is entered as a dictionary
in French and English first collected by Holyband, and
since augmented and altered by Cotgrave.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> But the work
which no doubt was of most help to Cotgrave was another
French-Latin dictionary, Aimar de Ranconnet's <i>Tresor de la
Langue Françoise</i>, revised by Nicot (1606).<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> He had, moreover,
read all sorts of books, old and new, in all dialects,
where he found words not heard of for hundreds of years,
which he included in his book, to be used or left as the
reader thought fit. J. L'Oiseau de Tourval,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> a Parisian,
and friend of Cotgrave, who wrote in French an epistle prefixed
to the dictionary, thought it advisable to assure the
reader that none of these words were of Cotgrave's invention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">-191-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">COTGRAVE'S DICTIONARY</span>observing at the same time that it would be well
to revive some of these obsolete and provincial terms.
He also adds that Cotgrave had sent to France in his eager
search for words. M. Beaulieu, secretary to the British ambassador
at Paris, was no doubt Cotgrave's collaborator in
this quest, as Cotgrave tells us elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> that he had received
valuable help from M. Beaulieu, as well as from a
certain Mr. Limery.</p>

<p>Cotgrave dedicated his dictionary to Wm. Cecil, Lord
Burghley, "his very good Lord and Maister," whose secretary
he was. He declares that he would have produced a
more substantial work to offer to his patron had not his
eyes failed him and forced him "to spend much of their
vigour on this bundle of words." He also offered a copy
to the eldest son of James I., Prince Henry, and received
from him a gift of £10.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> The price of the dictionary seems
to have been 11s. Cotgrave sent two copies to M. Beaulieu
at Paris, and wrote requesting payment of 22s., which they
cost him; for, he says, "I have not been provident enough
to reserve any of them and therefore am forced to be beholden
for them to a base and mechanicall generation, that
suffers no respect to weigh down a private gain."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>Cotgrave's dictionary was much superior to anything of
the sort which had yet appeared. In addition to giving the
meaning of each French word in English, with an indication
of its gender in the case of nouns, and, in the case of adjectives,
of the formation of the feminine form, Cotgrave supplied a
collection of illustrative phrases, idioms, and proverbs. At
the end are found "briefe directions for such as desire to
learne the French tongue," giving a succinct treatment of
the pronunciation of the letters, followed by a description of
the various parts of speech.</p>

<p>This really remarkable work, which is still of considerable
utility to the modern student, reigned supreme throughout
the greater part of the seventeenth century. A second edition
was issued in 1632, when Cotgrave was still alive. The only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">-192-</a></span>change in this issue is the addition of a "most copious Dictionarie
of the English set before the French by R. S. L."
This R. S. L. was Robert Sherwood, Londoner, who taught
French and English in London, and also had a French school
for a time. He gave his dictionary the title of <i>Dictionarie
Anglois et François pour l'utilité de tous ceux qui sont desireux
de deux langues</i>,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> and addressed it to the "favorables lecteurs
françois, alemans et autres." The English reader he advises
to look for fuller information as to "the gender of all French
nouns, and the conjugation of all French verbs" in Cotgrave's
dictionary; the small space to which he was limited did
not allow him to provide such information. Like Cotgrave,
Sherwood closes with rules of grammar, in the form of observations
on English pronunciation and on the English verbs.
Sherwood's work is the earliest of the English-French
dictionaries. Both Baret and Higgins had placed English
before French, and no doubt Sherwood made use of their
works, as well as of English-Latin dictionaries. Baret,
however, gives an indication of the greater demand there
was for French-English vocabularies, by supplying a table
of French words at the end of his work. Moreover, the
object of Sherwood's lexicon was less to facilitate translation
from English to French than to teach English to foreigners.</p>

<p>In 1650 Cotgrave's dictionary was issued in a revised and
augmented edition by James Howell, the famous letter-writer.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
This edition is preceded by a lengthy essay on the
French language, tracing its growth from the earliest times,
and taken, without acknowledgement, from Pasquier's
<i>Recherches</i>. Howell had already put much of the same matter
in a series of letters addressed to the Earl of Clare in his <i>Epistolae
Ho-Elianae</i>,<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> and repeated it in his glossary of English,
French, Italian, and Spanish, the <i>Lexicon Tetraglotten</i> (1660).
He quotes several examples of old French in both prose and
verse, and adds on his own account a praise of Richelieu and
the Academy recently founded by the cardinal. He also discusses
the question as to where the best French was spoken&mdash;at
the Court, among scholars at the University, or lawyers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">-193-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">JAMES HOWELL</span>at the Courts of Parliament&mdash;and is inclined to share the
general opinion of the day, which made the Court the supreme
arbiter in matters of language.</p>

<p>Cotgrave, it has been seen, included all sorts of words in
his dictionary. Howell thought it necessary to distinguish
obsolete and provincial words, and, accordingly, with the
help of "a noble and knowing French gentleman," he marked
such terms with a small cross. He also initiated another
change by placing the grammar before the dictionary instead
of after it, as Cotgrave did: "for a dictionary which contains
the whole bulk of a language to go before the grammar
is to make the building precede the basis. Therefore
it was held more consentaneous to reason, and congruous to
order that the grammar should be put here in the first place,
for Art observes the method of Nature to make us creep before
we go." He likewise made a few additions to Cotgrave's rules,
and appended a dialogue in French and English, "consisting of
some of the extraordinary and difficult criticall phrases which
are meer Gallicismes, and pure idiomes of the French tongue";
and also a passage of French prose, in the old spelling and
also according to the reformed orthography introduced by the
Academy.</p>

<p>In 1660 appeared another edition of Cotgrave, still further
enlarged by Howell.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Some years previously copies of the
edition of 1650, "with blank pages sown between the leaves,"
had been sent by the printer "to knowing persons, true lovers
of the French," who were invited to enter on the blank pages
any word they came across in their reading which was not in
the dictionary; by means of this plan several hundred additional
words were gathered together, many being "new
invented terms, which the admired Mons. Scudéry, and
other late Romancers have so happily publisht in their printed
volumes." After Howell's death there appeared yet another
issue of his edition of Cotgrave, in 1673.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The printer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">-194-</a></span>employed the same means to increase the number of words
as had been so successfully adopted in 1660.</p>

<p>The appearance of French dictionaries naturally facilitated
the reading of French literature, which in its turn had much
influence on the spread of the knowledge of the language.
Lord Herbert of Cherbury, it has been seen, gained his first
knowledge of French by reading it with the help of a dictionary.
And, in spite of the fact that French literature was
widely read in translations,<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> there were many who preferred
to read it in the original. The number of French books
in private libraries is enough to show this. One translator of
the time felt it necessary to apologize for offering an English
version (1627) "of the French Knight Lisander and his lady
Calista," contrary to the fashion of the time, "which is all
French."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Further testimony is found in the many French
books which were printed in England,<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> in addition to the
books in both French and English. And many English writers
of the time introduced French freely into their own English
compositions.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Almost all Englishmen of education could read French,
and many, no doubt, learnt it as Herbert did. Milton,
who differed from most of his countrymen in his decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">-195-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">STUDY OF FRENCH LITERATURE</span>preference for Italian, taught both languages to his two
pupils and nephews, Edward and John Philips, on this
method of reading. For Italian they read Giovanni Villani's
<i>History</i>, and for French "a great part of Pierre Davity, the
famous geographer of France in his time."<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> In fashionable
circles the case was the same, and French romances and
collections of <i>nouvelles</i> were much in vogue. Lady Brilliana
Harley, for instance, who later distinguished herself by
defending her castle in Herefordshire against the Royalists,
spent much of her time reading French literature. She wrote
asking her son, then at Magdalen College, Oxford (1638-9),
to send her books in French, as she "had rather reade any
thinge in that tounge than in Inglisch."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> She would even
while away days of sickness by translating passages of Calvin,
whom the English Protestants, yielding to the general prejudice
in favour of all things French, followed in preference to Luther.
Not infrequently, moreover, works in other languages were
read in French versions, just as such versions were frequently
the medium of translation; Drummond of Hawthornden read
<i>Orlando Furioso</i> and the <i>Azolani</i> of Bembo in French, as well
as the works of the Swiss theologian and follower of Zwingli,
Thomas Erastus.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>Among the most eager advocates of the reading of French
literature were naturally the French teachers of the time.
One of the chief objections raised against Holyband's system
of distinguishing the unpronounced letters was that the
student would be at a loss when he came to read French
books. Holyband, however, protested that such was not
the case, and that "the cavillation of these ignorantes who
measure other men's wit according to their owne" was in
contradiction to his experience, which daily showed him the
contrary. As to his reading, Holyband would first have
the learner "reade halfe a score chapters of the New Testament,
because it was both easie and profitable:<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> then let
him take in hand any of the works of Monsieur de Launay,
otherwise called Pierre Boaystuau, as the best and the most
elegant writer of our tongue. His workes be <i>le Theatre
du monde</i>, the tragicall histories, the prodigious histories.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">-196-</a></span>Sleidan's commentaries in frenche be excellently translated.
Philippe de Commins, when he is corrected is very profitable
and wise." The <i>Nouveau Testament</i> of de Bèze, Boiasteau's
<i>Théâtre du monde</i>, and Sleidan's <i>Commentaries</i><a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> were all books
well known in England, and Holyband himself prepared an
edition of Boiasteau.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> An additional reason, according to
him, for retaining the unsounded consonants was to facilitate
the reading of the older monuments of the French language.
He also advised the perusal of Marot's works, of the <i>Amadis</i>
of Herberay des Essarts, of François de Belleforest's <i>Histoire
Universelle du monde</i>, of the <i>Vies et Morales de Plutarque</i>, in
Amyot's version, and of the collection of stories, on the
plan of the <i>Decameron</i>, which its author, Jacques Yver, had
entitled <i>Le Printemps</i> (1572),<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> by way of contrast with his
own name.</p>

<p>Evidently Holyband's choice of French literature was
influenced to some extent by his religious sympathies. It
is curious that he makes no mention of Ronsard, who was
much read in England, and one of the favourite authors of
the Queen. Bellot in his Grammar had similar if not identical
ambitions. He sought to enable his pupils to read the <i>Amadis</i>
of Des Essarts, Marot, de Bèze, du Bellay's lyrics, Froissart,
Ronsard, Collet<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and Jodelle "racontans l'un l'amour
et l'autre la guerre cruelle." Pibrac and Du Bartas have
already been mentioned as favourite authors. It was to
encourage his pupils to take delight in the "profound learning
and flowing sweetness of the French poets, especially the divine
works of that matchlesse du Bartas," that a French teacher
of the seventeenth century, Pierre Erondell, printed at the
end of his book for teaching the language, the New Testament
story of the Centurion, rendered by himself into French verse.
"This poor work," he quaintly writes, will encourage learners
to read better ones, "because everything is better known
by his contrarye and the sweet sweeter, after that the mouth
hath tasted of the sharpe sower."</p>

<p>Naturally writings of a religious character were much in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">-197-</a></span>favour with these teachers.
<span class="sidenote">AUTHORS USUALLY READ</span>Holyband advised the reading of
de Bèze's New Testament, and several times we hear of "the
French Bible" being printed in England.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> The Liturgy in
French<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> was also printed, and would be useful to English
students of French attending the French Church.</p>

<p>French teachers were not the only zealous advocates of the
reading of French literature. Most of the writers on polite
education of the time give similar advice, although for different
reasons. "For statesmen, French authors are the best," wrote
Francis Osborne in his <i>Advice to a son</i>,<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> "and most fruitful in
negociations, and memoirs left by public ministers, and by their
secretaries published after their deaths." Cleland names the
works of the many learned historiographers of France he
would have the future diplomat and aspirant to the services of
the State read: "Engerrand of Munstrellet, Philip of Commines,
the Lord of Haillant, who is both learned and profitable and
pleasant in my conceit. The Commentaries of Bellay and the
Inventorie of John Serres, newlie printed and worthie to be
read, both for the good and compendious compiling of the
storie and also for the French eloquence wherin he floweth.
For militarie affairs, yee maie read the Lord of Noue, who is
somwhat difficil for some men, and also the Commentaries
of the L. Monluc, which are good both for a young souldier,
and an old captaine."<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>Bodin was another of the authors specially recommended.
Sir Philip Sidney counsels his brother Robert to read him
with particular attention, and James Howell<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> includes him in
a list of "good French writers," which varies slightly from that
of Cleland: "For the general history of France, Serres is
one of the best, and for the modern times, d'Aubigni, Pierre
Mathieu, and du Pleix: for the politicall and martiall government
du Haillan, De la Noue, Bodin, and the Cabinet: Touching
Commines, who was contemporary with Machiavel, 'twas
a witty speech of the last Queen mother of France that he
made more Heretiques in policy than Luther ever did in
religion. Therefore he requires a reader of riper years."</p>

religious topics; others belong to no particular category, in the style of Bellot's <i>Jardin

wars, were printed in French more to appeal to a larger public than to give instruction
in the language.</p></div>

<h3>FRENCH AT THE UNIVERSITIES</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> universities set the grammar schools the example by
neglecting the study of French and other subjects necessary
to a polite education. Even the limited encouragement given
to the modern language at the universities during the Middle
Ages no longer existed in the sixteenth century. At this
date Latin reigned supreme at Oxford and Cambridge, and its
use was rigorously enforced. The students were required "to
speak in Latin at public places" or otherwise "incur the
penalty contained in the statute regarding this point."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> It
is true that these regulations were not always obeyed; Fynes
Moryson says that scholars in the universities shun occasions
of speaking Latin. But it was none the less the chief language
cultivated at the universities,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> where no modern languages
received official recognition.</p>

<p>The mediaeval custom of using French on various academic
occasions had not, however, disappeared without leaving a
few traces. Some of the French forms of procedure favoured
in the Middle Ages, probably owing to the influence of the
University of Paris, were still in use at Cambridge in the
seventeenth century. The books of two Cambridge beadels,
Beadel Stokys (<i>c.</i> 1570) and Beadel Buck (1665),<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> show that
on several occasions these officials were instructed to use
French during public ceremonies. Thus, at the solemn exercise
of determination, one of the beadels gave thanks for the
money he and his fellows received, in the following terms:
"Noter Determiners je vous remercie de le Argent que vous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">-199-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH AND ITALIAN READ</span>avez donner a moy et a meis companiouns, pourquoy je prie
a Dieu que il vous veuille donner tres bonne vie et en la Fin
la Joye de Paradise." In similar "Stratford-atte-Bowe"
French they summoned the lecturers in the 'schools' to be
present on commencement day: "Nostre Seigneur Doctor,
une parolle sil vous Plaist, nostres Peres de nostres Seigneurs
Commencens vous prient que vous estes demayn a son commencement
en l'église de nostre Dame." And throughout
the ceremonies<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> in Arts and Theology similar French formulae,
often interspersed with Latin, were frequently used,
though they had probably passed out of use by the beginning
of the eighteenth century. But even at that time the summons
to dinner at New College still retained a trace of the old custom;
two choristers walked from the chapel door to the garden gate
crying, "Tempus est vocando, mangez tous seigneurs."</p>

<p>Yet modern languages were not entirely neglected by all
university students. Gabriel Harvey, in an interesting letter
to a certain Mr. Wood, says that the students of Cambridge
have "deserted Thomas Aquinas and the whole rabblement
of schoolmen for modern French and Italian works such as
Commines and Machiavell, Paradines in Frenche, Plutarche
in Frenche, and I know not how many outlandish braveryes
of the same stamp." "You can not stepp into a schollars
studye," he adds, "but (ten to on) you shall litely finde open
either Bodin <i>de Republica</i> or Le Royes exposition uppon
Aristotles Politiques, or some other like Frenche or Italian
Politique Discourses."<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>Thus we may safely conclude that French and to a
less extent Italian books were widely read at the universities.
No doubt, those who learnt Italian did so
with the help of a dictionary or an English translation,
like Lord Herbert of Cherbury. But there were additional
opportunities for learning the more popular language. French
tutors and French grammars were not unknown at both
Oxford and Cambridge. But it was at Oxford that they
were by far the more numerous. The tutors taught French
privately to those of the students who were willing to learn.
And Holyband in dedicating his <i>French Schoolemaister</i> (1573)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">-200-</a></span>to the young Robert Sackville, then a student at Oxford,
throws light on the attitude taken towards that language:
"not that you shuld leave off your weightier and worthier
studies in the Universitie, but when your mind is amazed
and dazled with long readinge, you may refresh and disport
you in learninge this [French] tongue."</p>

<p>Protestant refugees formed an important section of the
little band of private French tutors at Oxford. Many
Huguenots, frequently scholars of distinction, settled at the
English centres of learning. Some were promoted to positions
in the University,<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> on which they had a very beneficial influence,
just as others received preferment in the English
Church. The French tutors were among the humbler and
more numerous exiles who "taught privately," as the seventeenth-century
historian of the University, Anthony à Wood,
tells us. Apart from those who actually taught French, the
presence of considerable numbers of Frenchmen<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> cannot have
been without some indirect influence on the study of French
at Cambridge, as well as at Oxford.</p>

<p>In addition, several French tutors accompanied their pupils
to the University, and spent some time with them there.
Such, no doubt, was the case of Peter Du Ploich who, for
some unknown reason, was residing in Barnard College (now
St. John's), Oxford, early in the second half of the sixteenth
century. Another well-known French tutor, G. De la Mothe,
accompanied his pupil Richard Wenman to Oxford, some time
between 1587 and 1592. About ten years before, we come across
a famous Protestant, Jean Hotman, sieur de Villiers St. Paul,
resident at Oxford with his pupils, the sons of Lord Poulet,
English ambassador at Paris; while attending to the education
of his charges he completed his own, and received the degree
of Doctor. Subsequently he became secretary to Leicester,
and was thus brought into contact with the English Court.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
The younger Pierre Du Moulin likewise remained with his
pupil Richard Boyle when at Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Among tutors who
spent a short time at Oxford, and then joined the larger and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">-201-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH GRAMMARS PRINTED AT OXFORD</span>more successful group of language teachers in London, was
John Florio,<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> well known as a writer of books for teaching
Italian, and himself of Italian parentage, though born in
London. In about 1576 he became tutor for French and
Italian to Emmanuel, son of Richard Barnes, Bishop of
Durham, and to several other Oxford students. He was, we
are told, a "very useful man in his profession." Shortly after,
he removed to London, where he enjoyed favour at Court.</p>

<p>Of more importance, however, is the group of private tutors
who settled at Oxford, found a clientèle among the University
students, and frequently wrote and published French grammars
for the use of their pupils. There was evidently some demand
for instruction in French at Oxford early in the sixteenth
century. The bookseller John Donne enters a book called
<i>Frans and Englis</i> twice in the register of books he sold in
1520;<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> this may have been either Caxton's Book in French
and English, or the similar collection of dialogues printed by
Pynson and Wynkyn de Worde in turn.</p>

<p>The first book for teaching French printed at Oxford was
due to a Frenchman called Pierre Morlet, a native of Auteuil,
who taught French at Oxford in the last decade of the sixteenth
century. His <i>Janitrix sive institutio ad perfectam linguae
gallicae cognitionem acquirendum</i> was issued from the press of
Joseph Barnes in 1596.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> The dedication, dated from Broadgates
Hall the 5th of March of the same year, is addressed
to Morlet's former pupil, Sir Robert Beal. This rare little
treatise contains a few observations on the pronunciation of the
letters, followed by a concise treatment of each part of speech
in turn. It is preceded by a number of commendatory verses
in Latin and Greek, tributes from Morlet's pupils, students
of the various colleges. Morlet had previously prepared a
revised edition of Jean Garnier's French grammar, which was
published at Jena in 1593,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> no doubt before his coming to
England.</p>

<p>As might be expected, most of the early Oxford French
grammars, written for the use of Oxonians, differ from those
published at London in that they are composed in Latin.
They differ further in containing no practical exercises and
restricting their contents to rules of grammar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">-202-</a></span>All the French grammars published at Oxford were not
due to Frenchmen. In 1584 a Spanish refugee, Antonio
de Corro, resident at Christ Church, after acting as minister
of the Spanish Church in London, had anticipated Morlet by
adding a few rules on French pronunciation and accidence to
his Spanish Grammar,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> written in his own language. This
was subsequently translated into English in 1590 by J.
Thorius, also of Christ Church, and printed in London as
<i>The Spanish Grammer with certaine Rules teaching both the
Spanish and French tongues</i>. Several grammars were likewise
produced by Englishmen resident at Oxford, and teaching
the French language. Among others was John Sanford, or
Sandford, chaplain of Magdalen College, and the author of
the French grammar which succeeded Morlet's. Sanford
wrote in Latin, and entitled his work <i>Le Guichet François,
sive Janicula et Brevis Introductio ad Linguam Gallicam</i>. It
was published by Joseph Barnes in 1604,<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> and dedicated
to Dr. Bond, president of Magdalen. Sanford compiled his
observations on the pronunciation and parts of speech from
the various French grammars published in both France and
England; he drew largely on Morlet, as well as Bellot and
Holyband; and made equally free with de Bèze, Pillot,
and Ramus.</p>

<p>He varied his duties as chaplain by giving lessons in French.
In 1605 he was teaching French to that "hopefull young
gentleman Mr. William Grey, son to the Rt. Honourable Arthur
Lord Grey of Wilton," and found "good contentement" in
his "happy progresse therein." Called away temporarily by
other duties, Sanford made an English translation of the
Latin work, which he addressed to his young charge "as a
pledge of my duteous love towards your good deserts, and
as my substitute to supplie my absence, being willing also
for your sake to make a publicke use therof." The <i>Janicula</i>
appeared in its new form, much abridged as well as translated,
in 1605, under the title of <i>A Briefe Extract of the former Latin
Grammar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> It is significant that although this English translation
was printed by Barnes at Oxford, it was mainly
intended for a London public, and was "to be sold in Paules
Church Yard at the signe of the Crowne by Simon Waterson."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">-203-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">SALTONSTALL AND LEIGHTON</span>

Sanford retained his position at Magdalen for some years after
the appearance of his grammars. In about 1610 he was travelling
abroad as chaplain to Sir John Digby, whose acquaintance
he had made when Sir John was a student at Balliol.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>Other well-known English teachers of French at Oxford
were Wye Saltonstall and Henry Leighton. Wye Saltonstall
came of a noble family in Essex. He was educated at
Queen's College, Oxford, where "his descent and birth being
improved by learning, flatter'd him with a kinder fortune
than afterwards he enjoyed his life being all <i>Tristia</i>." He
is said to have then gone to Gray's Inn, Holborn, without
taking a degree at Oxford, and afterwards to have become a
perfect master of French, which he had acquired during his
travels. In 1625 he returned to Oxford for purposes of study
and converse with learned men. There he taught Latin and
French, and was still living in good repute in 1640 and after.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>Henry Leighton, on the other hand, had not so good a
reputation at the University. He is said to have been a man
of debauched character, and to have obtained the degree
of M.A. in anything but a straightforward manner; when
Charles I. created more than seventy persons M.A. on the
1st of November 1642, Leighton, who then bore a commission
in the king's army, contrived to have the degree conferred
on himself by presenting himself at dusk, when the light was
very low, though his name was not on the list. When the
king's cause declined, Leighton, who had received the greater
part of his education in France, and was an accomplished
French scholar, settled at Oxford as a teacher of French, and
had a room in St. John's College. Apparently he continued
to teach French until 1669, the year of his death.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>He was the author of a French grammar written in Latin,
called <i>Linguae Gallicae addiscendae regulae</i>, printed in 1659,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
and again in 1662. Beginning with rules for the pronunciation
of each letter, the author passes to observations on the
articles, nouns, pronouns, and verbs; he then returns to the
pronunciation, gives fuller rules for the more difficult sounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">-204-</a></span>and closes with a list of irregular verbs.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Leighton says
he published his work at the request of his friends. He
dedicated it (in French) to Henry O'Brien, baron of Ibrecken,
only son of the Earl of Thomond, expressing, in words very
like those used by Holyband on a similar occasion, the hope
that this "divertissement," as he calls the grammar, may help
to while away time not occupied by more serious and important
studies. Thus we see that the general attitude towards the
study of French was still, in the middle of the seventeenth century,
very much what it had been in the preceding century.</p>

<p>In the meantime other grammars had appeared from the
pens of French sojourners at Oxford. One, Robert Farrear,
a teacher of French, wrote a grammar in English for the use
of his pupils, <i>The Brief Direction to the French Tongue</i>,
printed at Oxford in 1618. Nothing further is known of its
author. Anthony à Wood<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> informs us that in the title of the
book Farrear inscribed himself M.A., but "whether he took
that degree or was incorporated therein in Oxford" he could
not discover.</p>

<p>The works on French which appeared at Oxford were not
all formal grammars of the type described. Pierre Bense, a
native of Paris, who taught Italian and Spanish as well as
French, was the author of the <i>Analogo-Diaphora seu Concordantia
Discrepans et Discrepantia Concordans trium linguarum
Gallicae, Italicae et Hispanicae</i>, commended by Edward Leigh
in his <i>Foelix Consortium or a fit Conjuncture of Religion and
Learning</i> (1663). This comparison of the resemblances and
differences in the grammar of the three languages is dedicated
to the University of Oxford, and was printed at the author's
own expense in 1637.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> As to Bense himself we are told that
he was partly bred "in good letters" at Paris, and then,
coming to England, "he went by letters commendatory to
Oxon where being kindly received and entertained, became
a sojourner there, was entred into the public library, and
taught for several years the French, Italian and Spanish
tongues." For the rest we must be content to add with
Wood: "What other things he hath written I know not, nor
any thing else of the author."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">-205-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">GABRIEL DU GRÈS</span>

As yet no French grammars had appeared at Cambridge,
and French teachers do not seem to have made their presence
felt there.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> In 1631, however, one of the best known of this
group of university French tutors arrived at Cambridge&mdash;Gabriel
Du Grès, a native of Saumur, and a member of a good
family from Angers. He arrived in England as a refugee on
account of his Protestant faith, received a warm welcome at
Cambridge, and taught French to several of the students in
various colleges.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> In the fifth year of his residence, the
liberality of his pupils enabled him to publish his <i>Breve et
Accuratum Grammaticae Gallicae compendium in quo superflua
rescinduntur et necessaria non omittuntur</i> (1636), a work on the
same lines and of about the same dimensions as that of Morlet.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
It is preceded by Latin verses addressed to the author by
members of different colleges, and is dedicated to the
students of the University, especially those engaged in the
study of French. This grammar of Du Grès appears to be
the only work of its kind printed at Cambridge before the
eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after its publication Du Grès joined the group of
French tutors at Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> and this removal points to the more
ready openings offered there to those of his profession. When
he published his <i>Dialogi Gallico-Anglico-Latini</i><a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> at Oxford in
1639, he was teaching French in that "most illustrious and
famous university." These dialogues are dedicated to Charles,
Prince of Wales. Twenty-one in number, they deal with
the usual familiar topics, greetings and the ordinary civilities,
visiting and table talk, the house and its contents, man and
the parts of his body, wayfaring, a journey to France, and
so forth, many being of much interest on account of the light
they throw on the customs of the time. Considerable space
is devoted to instructions for writing letters.</p>

<p>A second edition appeared in 1652, enlarged with "necessary
rules for the pronunciation of the French tongue, very
profitable unto them that are desirous of it," giving a pseudo-English
equivalent of the sound of each French letter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">-206-</a></span>followed by a few general rules for reading French and a table
of the auxiliary and regular verbs. This little book, which has
more in common with the productions of the London teachers
than with the Oxford manuals, enjoyed a greater popularity
than those of Du Grès's rivals. In 1660 a third edition
appeared, without the additions found in the second.</p>

<p>He was also the author of an interesting little work in
English on the Duke of Richelieu,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> printed in London in 1643.
Probably Du Grès had removed to London at that date; in
the second edition of his grammar, printed, like the first, by
Leonard Lichfield at Oxford, he describes himself as "late
teacher of the same in Oxford."</p>

<p>In his dialogues Du Grès gives some account of his ideas
on the teaching of French:<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>He agreed with most of the French teachers of the
day in attaching much importance to conversational practice
and reading. He also recommended a certain amount of
memorising and the study of grammar; general rules
and rules of syntax he considered indispensable; but for
pronunciation he thought practice of more avail than rules.
It is possible, he admits, to learn French by rote, without
any grammar rules. But it is not the best way in his
opinion. Without grammar rules the student cannot distinguish
good French from bad, nor can he translate, write
letters, or read; and reading, thought Du Grès, was an essential
condition if the cultivation of French in England was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">-207-</a></span>maintained.
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH AT CAMBRIDGE</span>Those who learn by ear are at a loss as soon as they
no longer hear French spoken daily. As for those who promise
to teach French in a short time, they are nothing but mountebanks.
Du Grès held that a man of moderate intellect could,
with hard work, learn to understand an ordinary French author
in three or four months. He had had, he declares, some pupils
at Cambridge who learnt to read and speak fairly well in four
months and others who learnt practically nothing in a whole
year.</p>

<p>At the end of the seventeenth century the status of French
at the universities had undergone no marked change. At the
time of the Restoration, a certain Philemon Fabri petitioned
Williamson for an appointment as Professor of French eloquence
at Oxford, "he having held a similar situation at Strasburg";
he supported his request by an address to the king in French
verses, entitled <i>Le Pater Noster des Anglais au Roi</i>. Apparently
Fabri did not receive the desired position.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> At Cambridge
we find still less encouragement given to the study of
French than at Oxford. During the Commonwealth, Guy
Le Moyne, formerly French tutor to Charles I., lived at Cambridge,
and no doubt continued to teach French there, as he
had done in London and at Court.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> At the Restoration he
petitioned Charles II. to let him have the Fellowship at
Pembroke Hall reserved for Frenchmen.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Le Moyne was
then seventy-two years old, and wished, he said, to end his
days at Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> At Cambridge, as at Oxford, there were
also French tutors in charge of particular pupils. Many of
these were French Protestants. Thus the famous Pierre Du
Moulin, arriving in England as a destitute refugee in 1588,
was received into the service of the Countess of Rutland, who
sent him to Cambridge as tutor to her son. There he remained
until 1592, continuing his own studies as well as attending to
those of his young charge. He thoroughly disliked his position,
and seized the first opportunity of leaving it.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> We also hear of
Herbert Palmer, President of Queen's College (1644-47), who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">-208-</a></span>had learnt French almost as soon as he could speak, and could
preach in French as well as in English.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> He won considerable
distinction as a college tutor, but whether he placed his
knowledge of French at the service of students, as Sanford
and Leighton did at Oxford, is not specified.</p>

<p>Yet, even at Oxford, the efforts of this band of French
teachers were not on a large enough scale to have any very
noticeable effect. Some gentlemen who, like Sanford's pupil,
William Grey, had gone to the University to make themselves
"fit for honourable imployments hereafter," took advantage
of such opportunities as there were of studying French.
Thus Henry Smith, while acting as tutor to Mr. Clifford,
learnt French himself, and wrote to Williamson in that
language.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> And no doubt the French tutors found enough
pupils among those who were drawn more towards the fashionable
than the scholastic world. But the inability of the young
Oxford student to speak French when in polite London circles
was a subject of comment in the seventeenth century as the
language became more and more widely cultivated. To speak
French was even considered incompatible with a university
education, to judge from this passage in one of Farquhar's
comedies:<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Sir H. Wildair.</i> Canst thou danse, child?</p>

<p><i>Bantu.</i> Oui, monsieur.</p>

<p><i>Lady Lurewell.</i> Heyday! French too! Why, sure, sir, you could
never be bred at Oxford!</p></div>

<p class="noi">To the same intent Pepys relates<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> how an Oxford scholar, "in a
Doctor of Lawe's gowne," whom he met at dinner at the Spanish
ambassador's, sat like a fool for want of French, "though a
gentle sort of scholar"; nor could he speak the ambassador's
language, but only Latin, which he spoke like an Englishman.
Pepys, on the other hand, was very pleased at the display he was
able to make of his own French on this occasion. The famous
diarist was a competent judge, and spoke and wrote the language
with ease. Unfortunately we know nothing of how he acquired
this knowledge, beyond the fact that he had not been to France.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">-209-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">ONE-SIDEDNESS OF UNIVERSITY EDUCATION</span>He often criticizes the French of those he meets, and a certain
Dr. Pepys, according to him, "spoke the worst French he
had ever heard from one who had been beyond sea."
Pepys's brother spoke French, "very plain and good," and
Mrs. Pepys, the daughter of a refugee Huguenot, was as
familiar with that language as with English.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>Thus the universities, like the schools, failed to keep in
touch with practical life by their neglect of the broader education
necessary to persons of quality and fashion. At the Inns
of Court, where gentlemen usually spent some time on leaving
the university,<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> or where they sometimes went instead of to
the university,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> the state of things was somewhat better.
Some knowledge of French was indispensable to those studying
the law, and the position of the Inns, almost all of them
within the boundaries of the ward of Farringdon Without,
the favourite abode of the French teachers, was such as to offer
exceptional facilities for the study of the language. When
Robert Ashley was at the Inner Temple he studied Spanish,
Italian, and Dutch, as well as French. We are told<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> that in
earlier times "knights, barons, and the greatest nobility of the
kingdom often placed their children in those Inns of Court, not
so much to make the laws their study, much less to live by the
profession ... but to form their manners and to preserve them
from contagion of vice." There, could be found "a sort of
gymnasium or academy fit for persons of their station, where
they learn singing and all kinds of music, dancing, and other
such accomplishments and Diversions ... as are suitable
to their quality and such as are usually practiced at Court."
French was, without doubt, one of these accomplishments.
Towards the end of the seventeenth century the Inns of Court
were still much in favour, and gentlemen's sons could enjoy
there good company and the innocent recreations of the town,
as well as improve themselves in the "exercises." Clarendon
calls the Inns of Court the suburbs of the Court itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">-210-</a></span>None the less, the gentleman with a university education,
even when it was followed by residence at one of the Inns of
Court, was felt to be inadequately equipped. Almost invariably
he sought on the Continent the polite accomplishments
and knowledge of languages, which were necessary qualifications
for high employment at Court, in the army, and elsewhere.
Travel came to be regarded as "an especial part"<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> of
the education of a gentleman, and as such occupies an important
place in the educational treatises of the time. The usual
course advised for the sons of gentlemen was an early study
of Greek and Latin, followed by residence at one of the
Universities and at the Inns of Court, and, finally, "travel
beyond seas for language and experience" and the study of
such arts as could not be easily acquired in England.</p>

<p>In some cases gentlemen were educated quite independently
of the English schools and universities<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>&mdash;at home with private
tutors, and in France. Lady Brilliana Harley, for instance,
feared that her son would not find much good company at
Oxford. "I believe," she wrote, "that theare are but feawe
nobellmens sonne in Oxford, for now, for the most part, they
send theaire sonnes into France when they are very yonge,
theaire to be breed."<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<h3>THE STUDY OF FRENCH BY ENGLISH TRAVELLERS ABROAD</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the favourite methods of learning French was a sojourn
in France. To speak the language well a visit there was
considered imperative, and to speak it "as one who had
never been out of England"<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> was synonymous with speaking
it badly. Consequently a journey to France was common
among the young gentry and nobility of the time. Moreover,
those who pursued their travels further, and undertook the
Grand Tour as many gentlemen did on leaving the university,
invariably visited France first, and spent the greater part
of their time there. Eighteen months in France, nine or ten
in Italy, five in Germany and the Low Countries, was considered
a suitable division of a three years' tour. Most
young Englishmen of family and fortune spent some time on
the Continent. Sir Francis Walsingham, said by one of his
contemporaries to have been the most accomplished linguist
of his day,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> had acquired his proficiency abroad, as had also
Lord Burghley, who wrote to Walsingham from France in
1583 to report on his progress in the language.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Both
ministers in their turn were patrons to numerous young
travellers in France. A certain Charles Danvers wrote to
Walsingham from Paris, in French, to show his progress and
thank him for his favours.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> And Burghley gave one Andrew
Bussy a monthly allowance of £5 to enable him to study
French at Orleans, where, according to his own account, he
took great pains to make good progress so as to serve his
patron the better on his return.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> It was generally held that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">-212-</a></span>travel was "useful to useful men,"<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> and that "peregrination"
well used was "a very profitable school, a running Academy."<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>Many young English gentlemen went to the French Court
in the train of an ambassador,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> or with a private tutor;<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
Henry VIII. sent his natural son, the Duke of Richmond,
Palsgrave's pupil, to the French Court, in the care of Lord
Surrey the poet. Richard Carew, the friend of Camden,
was sent to France with Sir Henry Nevill, ambassador to
Henri IV., and Bacon visited Paris in his early youth in the suite
of the diplomat Lord Poulet. The last-mentioned ambassador
had several young Englishmen in his charge. Of few, however,
could he make so favourable a report as he did of the son of
Sir George Speake: "I am not unacquainted with your son's
doings in Parris," he wrote to Sir George, "and cannot comend
him inoughe unto you aswell for his dilligence in study as
for his honest and quiett behaviour." One of these young
travellers, a Mr. Throckmorton, he was particularly glad to
be rid of; the young man "got the French tongue in good perfection,"
we are informed, but he was of flippant humour, and
before he left for England, Poulet told him his mind freely,
and forbade him to travel to Italy, as he intended to do later,
without the company of "an honest and wyse man." The
ambassador had kept him and his man in food during the
whole of his stay in Paris, and, besides, provided him with
a horse, which he had also "kept att his chardges."<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>Children too were often sent abroad for education. Thomas
Morrice, in his <i>Apology for Schoolmasters</i> (1619), commends
"the ancient and laudable custom of sending children abroad
when they can understand Latin perfectly"; for then they
learn the romance languages all the more easily, "because
the Italian, French and Spanish borrow very many words
of the said Latin, albeit they do chip, chop and change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">-213-</a></span>divers letters and syllables therein."
<span class="sidenote">ENGLISH GENTRY AT THE FRENCH COURT</span>And Thomas Peacham<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
tells us in the early seventeenth century that as soon as a
child shows any wildness or unruliness, he is sent either to
the Court to act as a page or to France, and sometimes to
Italy. The number of English children in France was, we
may assume, considerable; and when the news of the terrible
massacre of St. Bartholomew reached England, one
of its most noticeable effects was to fill with concern and
apprehension all parents who had children in France. "How
fearfull and carefull the mothers and parents that be here
be of such yong gentlemen as be there, you may easely ges,"
wrote Elizabeth's secretary of state to Sir Francis Walsingham,
the English ambassador at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Among these "yong
gentlemen" was Sir Philip Sidney, then newly arrived at the
French Court, whom Walsingham himself sheltered in the
ambassador's quarters during that awful night.</p>

<p>James Basset, the son of Lord Lisle, deputy at Calais for
Henry VIII., was sent to Paris in the autumn of 1536 to
complete his education, after having been for some time in
the charge of a tutor in England. There he went to school
with a French priest, whom he soon left for the College of
Navarre. He appears to have attended the college daily, and
boarded with one Guillaume le Gras, who, in June 1537,
wrote to Lady Lisle that her son would soon be able to speak
French better than English. "I think when he goes to see
you," writes the Frenchman to her ladyship who did not
understand French, "he will need an interpreter to speak
to you." James himself wrote to tell his mother how he was
progressing "at the large and beautiful college of Navarre,
with Pierre du Val his Master and Preceptor."<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> The following
letter<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> giving details on the course pursued by a young
English gentleman studying French in Paris may no doubt be
taken as fairly typical. "In the forenoone ... two hours
he spends in French, one in reading, the other in rendryng
to his teacher some part of a Latin author by word of mouth....
In the afternoon ... he retires himself into his chamber,
and there employs two other hours in reading over some
Latin author; which done, he translates some little part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">-214-</a></span>it into French, leaving his faults to be corrected the morrow
following by his teacher. After supper we take a brief survey
of all.... M. Ballendine [apparently the teacher] hath
commended unto us Paulus Aemilius in French, who writeth
the history of the country. His counsell we mean to follow."</p>

<p>Girls also were occasionally sent to France for purposes
of education. Two of James Basset's young sisters, Anne
and Mary, spent some time in that country. To prevent
their hindering each other's progress, Anne was committed
to the care of a M. and Mme. de Ryon, at Pont de Remy,
while Mary was sent to Abbeville to a M. and Mme. de
Bours. Both girls wrote letters in French to their mother,
Lady Lisle, and it appears that they had almost forgotten
their mother tongue. When Anne returned to England,
where she became maid of honour to Jane Seymour, she had
to apologize to her mother for not being able to write in
English, "for surely where your Ladyship doth think that I
can write English, in very deed I cannot, but that little that
I can write is French,"<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> and Mary wrote to her sister Philippa
in French expressing her wish to spend an hour with her
every day in order to teach her to speak French. In France
the two sisters acquired, besides French, the usual accomplishments
befitting their sex&mdash;needlework, and playing on
the lute and virginals.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>The traveller Fynes Moryson did not unreservedly approve
of the custom of sending children "of unripe yeeres" to France;
"howsoever they are more to be excused who send them with
discreet Tutors to guide them with whose eyes and judgments
they may see and observe.... Children like Parrots soone
learne forraigne languages and sooner forget the same, yea,
and their mother tongue also." He relates how a familiar friend
of his "lately sent his sonne to Paris, who, after two yeeres
returning home, refused to aske his father's blessing after the
manner of England, saying <i>ce n'est pas la mode de France</i>."<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
Milton in the same vein deplores the fact that his compatriots
have "need of the monsieurs of Paris to take their hopeful youth
into their slight and prodigal custodies and send them over
back again transformed into mimics, apes and kickshows."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">-215-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">ENGLISH CHILDREN IN FRANCE</span>"My countrymen in England," wrote Sir Amias Poulet from
Paris in 1577, "would doe God and theire countreye good
service if either they woulde provide scolemasters for theire
children at home, or else they woulde take better order of
their educacion here, where they are infected with all sortes
[of] pollucions bothe ghostly and bodylie and find manie
willinge scolemasters to teache theme to be badd subiects."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Nor were such sentiments confined to individual cases.
Queen Elizabeth was constantly making inquiries concerning
her subjects beyond the seas generally, often for political
reasons or on account of her Protestant fears of popery. She
found "noe small inconvenience to growe into the realm"
by the number of children living abroad "under colour of
learning the languages." In 1595 she ordered a list of such
"children" to be sent to her with the names of their parents
or guardians and tutors,<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and there were frequent examinations
of subjects suspected of desiring to go abroad; in
1595 the Mayor of Chester writes to Burghley to know what
he is to do with two boys, aged fifteen and seventeen, who have
been brought before him on suspicion of intending to travel
into France to learn the language, and thence into Spain.</p>

<p>The objections raised against the journey to France were
few, however, in comparison with those alleged as regards
Italy. Italy held a place second only to France in the Grand
Tour on the Continent, and in the early sixteenth century the
first enthusiasm awakened by the Renaissance attracted
many Englishmen there. Scholars, such as Linacre and
Colet, set the example. Then others, including most literary
men of the time, made their way as pilgrims to the centre
of the revived learning, passing through France on their
way.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> Soon the journey became largely a matter of fashion.
This rapid development of the custom of continental travel
was looked upon as a danger in matters political and
religious; popish plots were suspected and foreign intrigues
of all kinds feared. In Elizabeth's time leave "to resort
beyond seas for his better increase in learning, and his
knowledge of foreign languages"<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> was not freely granted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">-216-</a></span>to any who might apply. Lord Burghley would often
summon before him applicants for licences to travel, and
look carefully into their knowledge of their own country,<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> and
if this proved insufficient, would advise them to improve it
before attempting to study other countries.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>Voluble were the protests against foreign travel which
were made in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. France
and above all Italy were made responsible for all the vices
of the English. It was urged that trade and state negotiations
were the only adequate reasons for travel abroad. "We are
moted in an Island, because Providence intended us to be shut
off from other regions," Bishop Joseph Hall affirms, in his <i>Quo
Vadis: a juste censure of travel as it is commonly undertaken by
gentlemen of our own nation</i> (1617). So strong were the prejudices
of some of these critics that the grandfather of the
royalist Sir Arthur Capell wrote&mdash;in 1622&mdash;a pamphlet containing
<i>Reasons against the travellinge of my grandchylde Arthur
Capell into the parts beyond the sea</i>, in which he draws an
alarming picture of the dangers of infection from popery, and
seeks to prove that the time could be much better spent at
home.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> The chronicler Harrison went so far as to assert that
the custom would prove the ruin of England.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> And even the
courtly Lyly could write: "Let not your mindes be carried
away with vaine delights, as travailing into farre and straunge
countries, wher you shall see more wickednesse then learn
virtue and wit."<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>But it was Italy much more than France that excited the
fears of these alarmists. There was a common saying at the
time that an Englishman Italianate was a devil incarnate.
"I was once in Italy myself," wrote Roger Ascham,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> "but I
thank God my abode there was but nine dayes"&mdash;in which he
saw more wickedness than he had beheld during nine years in
London. "Suffer not thy sons to pass the Alpes, for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">-217-</a></span>shall learn nothing there but Pride, Blasphemy and Atheism;
<span class="sidenote">PROTESTS AGAINST FOREIGN TRAVEL</span>and if by travelling they get a few broken Languages, that will
profit them no more than to have the same meat served in
divers dishes," was the advice of Lord Burghley.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Many
were the precautions taken to prevent English subjects from
travelling to Rome of all places. Travellers who were suspected
of such intentions or who had travelled abroad without
permission were rigorously examined. One such traveller
confessed that he went to Brittany and France to see
the countries and learn the language, but swore he had
never been to Rome or spoken to the papist Cardinal
Allen.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Many passports issued for the Grand Tour stipulated
specifically that the traveller should not repair to
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>George Carleton gave expression to the general feeling
when he wrote to his brother Dudley, afterwards Lord
Dorchester: "I like your going to France much better than
if you had gone to Italy."<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> "France is above all most
needful for us to mark," was the advice Sir Philip Sidney
sent to his brother Robert on his travels.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Sir John Eliot
gave similar injunctions to his sons.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> France was, he said,
a country full of noble instincts and versatile energy; and
what his own experience had been, he recommended his sons
to profit by. Some friend had warned them of possible
dangers in France. Heed them not, says Eliot; any hazard
or adventure in France they will find repaid by such advantages
of knowledge and experience as observation of the
existing troubles there is sure to convey. But he will not
allow them even to enter Spain; and the Italian territories
of the Church they must avoid as dangerous: "stagnant
and deadly are the waters in the region of Rome, not clear
and flowing for the health-seeking energies of man." He
thought, however, that some parts of Italy might be visited
with profit. To attempt to learn the Italian language before
some knowledge of French had been acquired, was not discreet.
"Besides it being less pleasant and more difficult
to talk Italian first," he writes, "it was leaving the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">-218-</a></span>necessary acquirement to be gained when there was, perchance,
less leisure for it. Whereas by attaining some perfection
in French, and then moving onward, what might be
lost in Italy of the first acquirement, would be regained in
France as their steps turned homeward."</p>

<p>Not only were fears of Roman Catholicism and corrupt
manners directed more specifically toward Italy than France,
but the French language was considered a much more necessary
acquirement than Italian. It was generally agreed that
the country most requisite for the English to know was
France, "in regard of neighbourhood, of conformity in
Government in divers things and necessary intelligence of
State."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>. "French is the most useful of languages&mdash;the
richest lading of the traveller next to experience&mdash;Italian
and Spanish not being so fruitful in learning," remarks
Francis Osborne in his <i>Advice to a Son</i>.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Thus the main object of study of the traveller in France
was usually the language itself, and next to that the polite
accomplishments. Those who continued their travels into
Italy were attracted chiefly by the country and its antiquities.
When Addison was in France, after a short stay
in Paris in 1699<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> he settled for nearly a year at Blois to
learn the language, living in great seclusion, studying, and
seeing no one but his teachers, who would sup with him
regularly. In 1700 he returned to Paris, qualified to converse
with Boileau and Malebranche. But he spent his
time in Italy very differently, living in fancy with the old
Latin poets, taking Horace as his guide from Naples to Rome,
and Virgil on the return journey: there was no question of
settling down in a quiet town to study Italian. The experience
of Lord Herbert of Cherbury at the end of the sixteenth century
and of Evelyn in the middle of the seventeenth was of a similar
nature. Though travellers continued to include Italy in their
tour, the feeling in favour of France became stronger and
stronger. It reached its climax in the latter half of the seventeenth
century, when Clarendon wrote: "What parts soever
we propose to visit, to which our curiosity usually invites us,
we can hardly avoid the setting our feet first in France."
And he invites travellers, on returning there after visiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">-219-</a></span>Italy,
<span class="sidenote">THE TRAVELLING TUTOR</span>to stay in Paris a year to "unlearn the dark
and affected reservation of Italy."
As for Germany, he thinks they have need to remain two years in France
that they may entirely forget that they were ever in
Germany!<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>The sons of gentlemen setting out on the Grand Tour were
usually accompanied by a governor or tutor,<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> and the need for
such a guide was generally recognized by writers on travel; all
urge the necessity of his being acquainted with the languages
and customs of the countries to be visited. "That young
men should Travaile under some Tutor or grave Servant, I
allow well: so that he be such a one that hath the language
and hath been in the Countrey before," wrote Bacon. And
if any one was not able or did not wish to "be at the charges
of keeping a Governor abroad" with his son, he was advised<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
to "join with one or two more to help to bear the charges: or
else to send with him one well qualified to carry him over and
settle him in one place or other of France, or of other Countries,
to be there with him 2 or 3 months, leave him there after
he hath set him in a good way, and then come home."
We also gather from Gailhard's <i>The Compleat Gentleman</i>
that it was "a custom with many in England to order
Travelling to their sons, as Emetick Wine is by the Physician
prescribed to the Patient, that is when they know not
what else to do, and when schools, Universities, Inns of
Court, and every other way hath been tried to no purpose:
then that nature which could not be tamed in none of these
places, is given to be minded by a Gouvernor, with many a woe
to him."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>The suitable age for the Grand Tour, as distinct from
the shorter journey in France, was the subject of much
discussion. It was usually undertaken between the ages
of sixteen and twenty, and occupied from three to five
years. Some, and among them Locke,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> agreed with Gailhard
in thinking that travel should not come at the end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">-220-</a></span>They argued that languages were more easily learnt at an
earlier age, and that children were then less difficult to
manage. Others, regarding travel as a necessary evil,<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> held
that, at a later age, travellers are less receptive of evil
influences and the snares of popery. This was the current
opinion.</p>

<p>In many cases, especially in later times, the travelling
tutor was a Frenchman. Many Englishmen, however, found
in this capacity an opportunity for travel which they might
not otherwise have had. For example, Ben Jonson visited
Paris in 1613 as tutor to the son of Sir Walter Raleigh, and
became better known there as a reveller than as a poet.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
In the same way Ben Jonson's friend, the poet Aurilian
Townsend, accompanied Lord Herbert of Cherbury on his
foreign tour in 1608, and was of much help to him on account
of his fluent knowledge of French, Italian, and Spanish.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> The
time-serving politician Sir John Reresby travelled with a

philosopher Thomas Hobbes spent as travelling tutor in the
Cavendish family many years which he calls the happiest
time of his life. He visited France, Germany, and Italy.
For a time he left the Cavendishes to act as tutor to the son
of Sir Gervase Clifton, with whom he remained eighteen months
in Paris. It was while travelling with his pupils that Hobbes
became known in the philosophic circles of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Addison
was offered a salary of £100 to be tutor to the Duke of Somerset,
who desired him "to be more of a companion than a
Governor," but did not accept the offer.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> In some cases the
travelling tutor had several pupils. Thus Mr. Cordell, the
friend of Sir Ralph Verney, was tutor to a party of Englishmen.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Sir Philip Sidney travelled without
a governor. At Frankfort, in the house of the Protestant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">-221-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">BOOKS ON TRAVEL</span>printer Andreas Wechel, he began his life-long friendship
with the Huguenot scholar Hubert Languet, who,
to some degree, supplied his needs. Languet, however, expresses
his regret that Sidney had no governor, and when the
young Englishman continued his journey into Italy they kept
up a correspondence, in the course of which Languet sent
Sidney much good advice. At his instigation Sidney practised
his French and Latin by translating some of Cicero's letters into
French, then from French into English, and finally back into
Latin again, "by a sort of perpetual motion."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> John Evelyn
the diarist also travelled without a governor, while the eldest
son of Lord Halifax first made the Grand Tour in the usual
fashion, and afterwards returned to his uncle, Henry Savile,
English ambassador at Paris, without the "encumbrance"
of a governor. Savile superintended his nephew's reading,
providing him with books on such subjects as political treaties
and negotiations, and warning him against "nouvelles" and
other "vain <i>entretiens</i>."<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>The practice of travelling abroad called forth many books
on the subject, often written by travellers desiring to place
their experience at the service of others. Such books usually
include indications of the routes to be followed and the places
to be visited, and sometimes advice as to the best way of studying
abroad. Some, such as those of Coryat, Fynes Moryson, and
Purchas,<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> are descriptions of long journeys. Others deal more
especially with the method of travel.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> A few were written for
the particular use of some traveller of high rank; for instance,
when the Earl of Rutland set out on his travels in 1596, his
cousin Essex sent him letters of advice, which circulated
at Court, and were published as <i>Profitable Instructions for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">-222-</a></span>Travellers</i> in 1633.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> Further information was supplied in the
treatises on polite education.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>The subject of travel was thus continually under consideration,
and the different books of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries which deal with this topic are of great
interest. Robert Dallington, the author of an early guide to
France,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> thought it necessary, seeing the few teachers there
were in France, to "set downe a course of learninge." "I
will presume to advise him," he says of the traveller to
France, "that the most compendious way of attaining the
tongue is by booke. I mean for the knowledge, for as for the
speaking he shall never attaine it but by continuall practize
and conversation: he shall therefore first learne his nownes
and verbs by heart, and specially the articles, and their uses,
with the two words <i>sum</i> and <i>habeo</i>: for in these consist the
greatest observation of that part of speech." He also urges
the future traveller to engage a Frenchman to assist him,
chiefly, no doubt, with reading and pronunciation. This
"reader," as Dallington calls him, "shall not reade any booke
of Poetrie at first, but some other kinde of stile, and I thinke
meetest some moderne comedie. Let his lecture consist more
in questions and answers, either of the one or the other, then
in the reader's continued speech, for this is for the most part
idle and fruitlesse: by the other many errors and mistakings
either in pronunciation or sense are reformed. After three
months he shall quit his lectures, and use his Maister only to
walk with and discourse, first the one and then the other: for
thus shal he observe the right use of the phrase in his Reader,
heare his owne faults reproved and grow readie and prompt
in his owne deliverie, which, with the right straine of the
accent, are the two hardest things in language." He should
also read much in private, and "to this reading he must adde
a continuall talking and exercising of his speech with all sorts
of people, with boldnesse and much assurance in himselfe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">-223-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">A "METHOD OF TRAVEL"</span>for I have often observed in others that nothing hath more
prejudiced their profiting then their owne diffidence and
distrust. To this I would have him adde an often writing,
either of matter of translation or of his owne invention, where
againe is requisite the Reader's eye, to censure and correct:
for who so cannot write the language he speaks, I count he
hath but halfe the language. There, then, are the two onely
meanes of obtaining a language, speaking and writing, but the
first is the chiefest, and therefore I must advertise the traveller
of one thing which in other countries is a great hinderer
thereof, namely, the often haunting and frequenting of our
own Countrimen, whereof he must have a speciall care,<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
neither to distaste them by a too much retirednesse<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> nor to
hinder himselfe by too much familiaritie."</p>

<p>A few years later Fynes Moryson<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> offered equally sound
advice to the traveller "for language." "Goe directly to the
best citie for the puritie of language," he tells him, and first
"labour to know the grammar rules, that thy selfe mayst know
whether thou speaketh right or no. I meane not the curious
search of those rules, but at least so much as may make thee able
to distinguish Numbers, Cases, and Moodes." Moryson thought
that by learning by ear alone students probably pronounced
better, but, on the other hand, with the help of rules, "they
both speake and write pure language, and never so forget it,
as they may not with small labour and practice recover it
again." The student, he adds, should make a collection of
choice phrases, that "hee may speake and write more eloquently,
and let him use himselfe not to the translated formes
of speech, but to the proper phrases of the tongue." For this
purpose he should read many good books, "in which kind, as
also for the Instruction of his soule, I would commend unto
him the Holy Scriptures, but that among the Papists they are
not to be had in the vulgar tongue, neither is the reading of them
permitted to laymen. Therefore to this purpose he shall
seeke out the best familiar epistles for his writing, and I thinke
no booke better for his Discourse then Amadis of Gaule....
In the third place I advise him to professe Pythagoricall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">-224-</a></span>silence, and to the end he may learne true pronunciation,
not to be attained but by long observation and practice, that
he for a time listen to others, before he adventure to speake."
He should also avoid his fellow-countrymen, and, having
observed these rules, "then let him hier some skilfull man to
teach him and to reprove his errors, not passing by any his
least omission. And let him not take it ill that any man
should laugh at him, for that will more stirre him up to
endevour to learne the tongue more perfectly, to which end
he must converse with Weomen, children and the most
talkative people; and he must cast off all clownish bashfulnesse,
for no man is borne a Master in any art. I say not that
he himselfe should rashly speake, for in the beginning he shall
easily take ill formes of speaking, and hardly forget them
once taken."</p>

<p>The learning of French in England before going abroad
did not, as a rule, enter into the plan of writers on the subject
of travelling. Moryson, however, realized that "at the first
step the ignorance of language doth much oppresse (the
traveller) and hinder the fruite he should reape by his iourney."
And Bacon went a step further when he wrote that "he that
travaileth into a Country, before he hath some entrance into
the language, goeth to schoole, and not to travaile.... If
you will have a Young Man to put his Travaile into a little
Roome, and in a short time to gather much, this you must doe.
First, as was said, he must have some Entrance into the
Language before he goeth. Then he must have such a
Servant, or Tutor, as knoweth the country."<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Later writers
usually agree that it would be of benefit to have "something
of the French"<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> before leaving England, "though it were
only to understand something of it and be able to ask for
necessary things," or to have "some grammatical instruction
in the language, as a preparation to speaking it."<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> And
indeed many travellers had some previous knowledge of
French. Sir Philip Sidney, for instance, could manage a letter
in French when he was at school at Shrewsbury; Lord Herbert
of Cherbury had studied the language with the help of a dictionary;
Sir John Reresby, at a later date, had learnt French
at a private school, though, like many students nowadays,
he could not speak the language on his arrival in France.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">-225-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">STUDIES PREVIOUS TO TRAVEL</span>Several went abroad to "improve" themselves in French, and
no doubt the phrase "to learn the French tongue"<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> often
meant to learn to speak it.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, however,
many of those who studied French seriously in England did
not go to France. Among these were the ladies, to whose
skill Mulcaster<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> draws the attention of travellers, as a proof
that languages can be learnt as well at home as abroad; and
not a few of the younger sons of noblemen,<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> as well as the
prosperous middle class&mdash;the frequenters of the French schools
in St. Paul's Churchyard, and the pupils of Du Ploich and
Holyband, neither of whom makes any reference to the tour
in France.</p>

<p>The "common practice" in the sixteenth century among
young travellers was to proceed to France knowing no French.
They fully expected to learn the language there, with no further
exertion than living in the country. They are constantly
warned of the futility of such expectations. Dallington, Fynes
Moryson, and others lay much emphasis on the necessity of
some serious preliminary study of grammar and reading of good
literature. French teachers in England compared the poor
results obtained in France by these leisurely methods with
those achieved by their own efforts in England. No doubt
they found the practice of learning French by residence in
France a serious rival to their own methods. De la Mothe,<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>
for instance, declares he knows English ladies and gentlemen
who have never left England and yet speak French incomparably
better than others who have been in France three or
four years trying to pick up the language by ear, as most
travellers do. Another French teacher<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> writes: "I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">-226-</a></span>knowne three Gentlemen's sonnes, although I say it that
should not say it, who can testify yet, that in their return
from France (after they had remained foure yeares at Paris,
spending a great deal of money) perused my rules but six
moneths and did confesse they reaped more good language
in that short space I taught them then in all the time they
spent in France. And sundry others I have helped who
never saw France, and yet could talke, read and write
better language in one yeare than those who have bene
at Paris two yeares, learning but the common phrase of the
countrie, shacking off a litle paines to learne the rules."</p>

<p>While holding that French could be better learnt in England
with rules than in France without any such assistance, the
French teachers of London admitted that the language could
perhaps be best learnt in France, but only with the help of a
good teacher and serious study, as in England. However, there
were hardly any language teachers in France, according to them,
while in England it was easy to find many good ones. Dallington
more specifically bewails the fact that the traveller finds a
"great scarcitie" of such tutors, and directs him to a certain
M. Denison, a Canon of St. Croix in Orleans, after whom he
may inquire, "except his good acquaintance or good fortune
bring him to better."</p>

<p>There was indeed little provision for the serious study of
French in France before the end of the sixteenth century.
Most travellers, we are told, "observed only for their owne use."
Few Frenchmen took up the teaching of their own language to
foreigners as a profession, and those who taught from time to
time or merely upon occasion rarely proved successful. Yet
the earliest grammars produced in France were intended largely
for the use of foreigners. Special attention is paid to points
which usually offered difficulty to foreigners, such as the pronunciation
and its divergencies from the orthography.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> Sylvius
or Du Bois, writing in Latin,<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> remarks that his principles may
serve the English, the Italians and Spaniards, in short, all
foreigners; no doubt those he had chiefly in mind were the
numbers of English and other foreign students at the University
of Paris. When the earliest grammar written in French
appeared, its author, Louis Meigret,<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> sought to justify his use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">-227-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">LANGUAGE TEACHERS IN FRANCE</span>of the vernacular by suggesting that foreign students should
first learn to understand French by speaking and reading good
French literature, instead of depending on Latin for the first
stages. He had noticed the peculiarities of the English pronunciation
of French, especially the habit of misplacing the
accent; "they raise the voice on the syllable <i>an</i> in <i>Angleterre</i>,
while we raise it on the syllable <i>ter</i>: so that French as spoken
by the English is not easily understood in France." From
other grammarians foreigners always received some attention.
Pillot<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> and Garnier<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> both wrote in Latin with a special view
to foreigners; and Peletier,<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> who used French, retains all the
etymological consonants, that strangers may find Latin helpful
in understanding French.</p>

<p>Not before the end of the sixteenth century, however, do we
hear of the first important language teacher in France&mdash;Charles
Maupas of Blois, a surgeon by profession, who spent most of his
life, more than thirty years, teaching French to "many lords and
gentlemen of divers nations" who visited his native town. He
was "well known to be a famous teacher of the French tongue
to many of the English and Dutch nobility and gentry." For
his English pupils Maupas showed particular affection.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> And
from them he received in turn numerous proofs of friendship.
Among the Englishmen who learnt French under his care was
George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, who, at about the age
of eighteen, travelled into France, where "he improved himself<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>
well in the language for one that had so little grammatical
foundation, but more in the exercises of that Nobility for the
space of three years and yet came home in his naturall plight,
without affected formes (the ordinary disease of Travellers)."<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
Maupas bears stronger testimony to his pupil's attainments in
the French language, and some years later he gratefully dedicated
to the Duke his French grammar, first issued publicly in 1618.</p>

<p>Maupas's <i>Grammaire françoise contenant reigles tres certaines
et adresse tres asseurée a la naïve connoissance et pur usage de
nostre langue. En faveur des estrangers qui en seront desireux</i>,
was first privately printed in 1607.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> He had not originally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">-228-</a></span>intended it for publication. The work grew out of the notes
and observations he compiled in order to overcome his pupils'
difficulties. As these rules increased in number and importance,
many students began to make extracts from them;
others made copies of the whole, a "great and wearisome
labour." Finally, Maupas, touched by this keenness, resolved
to have a large number of copies printed. He distributed
these among his pupils and their friends, till, contrary to his
expectation, he found he had none left. It was then that
the first public edition was issued at Lyons in 1618, and was
followed by six others, which were not always authorized.
A Latin edition also appeared in 1623.</p>

<p>Maupas insists on the necessity of employing a tutor. "Let
them come to me," he says, addressing foreigners desirous
of learning French, "if it is convenient."<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> To learn the
language by ear and use alone is impossible. The small outlay
required to engage a teacher saves much time and labour.
As to the grammar, it should be read again and again, and
in time all difficulties will disappear; it will be of great use
even to those already advanced in French. He undertook to
teach and interpret the grammar in French itself, without
having recourse to the international language Latin, the usual
medium of teaching French to travellers; he tells us that
many of his pupils were ignorant of Latin, and that the practice
of interpreting the grammar in French had been adopted
by many of his fellow-teachers in other towns. The great
advantage of this method was, he thought, that reading and
pronunciation are learnt conjointly with grammar, the phrases
and style of the language together with its rules and precepts.
Besides, the student must read some book; and a grammar
was, in his opinion, preferable to the little comedies and
dialogues usually resorted to for this purpose. He did not,
however, forget that some light reading was a greater incentive
to the learner, and in practice used both.</p>

<p>Maupas died in 1625, when a new edition of his grammar
was in preparation. His son, who assisted him in teaching,
saw the work through the press, and invited students to
transfer to him the favours they had bestowed on his father.
Apparently the younger Charles Maupas continued to teach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">-229-</a></span>his father's clientèle for some time. <span class="sidenote">CHARLES MAUPAS OF BLOIS</span>In 1626 he gave further
proof of his zeal for the cause in editing and publishing a
comedy which both he and his father had frequently read
with pupils not advanced enough for more serious matter.
We are told vaguely that this comedy, entitled <i>Les Desguisez:
Comedie Françoise avec l'explication des proverbes et mots difficiles
par Charles Maupas a Bloys</i>, was the work of one of the
<i>beaux esprits</i> of the period.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Maupas, however, only had one
copy, and knew not where to procure more. He was induced
to have it printed on seeing the great labour and time expended
by many of his pupils in making copies of it for their own
use. For the benefit of students who had no tutor, he added
an explanatory vocabulary of proverbs and difficult words.</p>

<p>Maupas's <i>Grammaire et syntaxe françoise</i> is still looked on
with respect.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> The reputation it enjoyed in the seventeenth
century is the more remarkable in that it was the work of a
provincial who had no relations with the Court, then the
supreme arbiter in matters of language. But the grammar
passed into oblivion in the course of time, as more modern
manuals took its place. Maupas's hope that it would be used
by foreign students of French as long as the language was
held in esteem was not to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>His Grammar was superseded by that of Antoine Oudin&mdash;<i>Grammaire
Françoise rapportée au langage du temps</i>, Paris,
1632. Oudin's original intention had been merely to enlarge
the grammar of his predecessor. But as his work advanced he
found "force antiquailles" and many mistakes, besides much
confusion, repetition, and pedantry. He felt no compunction
in telling the reader that he had enormously improved all he
had borrowed from Maupas&mdash;although he is careful to note
that he has no intention of damaging his rival's reputation,
and is proud to share his opinion on several points. He had
a great advantage over Maupas in having spent all his life
in close connexion with the Court; his father, César, had been
interpreter to the French king, and Antoine succeeded him in
that office. He also appears to have had continual relations
with foreigners, and he tells us on one occasion that he
received from them "very considerable benefits." His grammar
was certainly much used by foreign students, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">-230-</a></span>it does not seem to have enjoyed as great a popularity in
England as that of Maupas. Oudin's <i>Curiositez Françoises</i>
(1640) was also addressed "aux estrangers," and his aim was
to show his gratitude by attempting to call attention to the
mistakes which had made their way into grammars drawn up
for their instruction.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p><i>L'Eschole Françoise pour apprendre a bien parler et escrire
selon l'usage de ce temps et pratique des bons autheurs, divisée
en deux livres dont l'un contient les premiers elements, l'autre
les parties de l'oraison</i> (Paris, 1604), by Jean Baptiste du Val,
avocat en Parlement at Paris and French tutor to Marie de
Medicis, was also intended partly for the use of foreigners.
He seeks to console foreign students coping with the difficulties
of French pronunciation and orthography, by assuring
them that though the French themselves may be able to
speak correctly, they cannot prescribe rules on this score.
As for his grammar, the student will learn more from it in
two hours than from any other in two weeks. He also takes
up a supercilious attitude, natural in one who exercised his
profession in the precincts of the Court, towards anything
that resembled a provincial accent; better no teacher at all
than one with a provincial accent.</p>

<p>Among other grammars of similar purport is that of
Masset in French and Latin, <i>Exact et tres facile acheminement
a la langue Françoyse, mis en Latin par le meme autheur pour
le soulagement des estrangers</i> (1606);<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> and to the same category
belongs also the <i>Praecepta gallici sermonis ad pleniorem perfectioremque
eius linguae cognitionem necessaria tum suevissima
tum facillima</i> (1607), by Philippe Garnier, who, after teaching
French for many years in Germany, settled down at Orleans,
his native town, as a language tutor.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p>Another work widely used by travellers, and well known in
England, was the <i>Nouvelle et Parfaite Grammaire Françoise</i>
(1659) of Laurent Chiflet, the zealous Jesuit and missionary,
which continued to be reprinted until the eighteenth century,
and enjoyed for many years the highest reputation among
foreign students of French. The Swiss Muralt relates how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">-231-</a></span>he <span class="sidenote">FRENCH GRAMMARS FOR TRAVELLERS</span>and a friend were inquiring for some books at one of the
booksellers of the Palais, the centre of the trade; and how the
bookseller answered them civilly and tried to find what they
desired, until his wife interfered, crying, "Ne voiez vous pas
que ce sont des etrangers qui ne savent ce qu'ils demandent?
Donnez leur la grammaire de Chiflet, c'est là ce qu'il leur faut."<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>Chiflet is very explicit in his advice to foreign students.
In the first place the pronunciation should be learnt by reading
a short passage every day with a French master, and the
verbs most commonly in use committed to memory. Then
the other parts of speech and the rules of syntax should
be studied briefly; but care should be taken not to neglect
reading, and to practise writing French, in order to become
familiar with the orthography. One of his chief recommendations
is to avoid learning isolated words; words should always
be presented in sentence form, which is a means of learning
their construction and of acquiring a good vocabulary at the
same time. The rest of the method consists in translating
from Latin or some other language into French, and in
conversing with a tutor who should correct bad grammar or
pronunciation. When once a fair knowledge of French is
acquired, it should be strengthened by reading and reflecting
upon some good book every day. Such reading is the shortest
way of learning the language perfectly. Excellence and
fluency in speaking may be attained by repeating or reciting
aloud the substance of what has been read.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>The acquisition of the French language was not the only
ambition of the English gentleman abroad. His aim was also
to acquire those polite accomplishments in which the French
excelled&mdash;dancing, fencing, riding, and so on. For this purpose
he either frequented one of the "courtly" academies or
engaged private tutors; and "every master of exercise," it
was felt, served as a kind of language master.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> We are
indebted to Dallington<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> for an account of the cost of such a
course abroad. "Money," he says, "is the soule of travell.
If he travel without a servant £80 sterling is a competent
proportion, except he learn to ride: if he maintain both these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">-232-</a></span>charges, he can be allowed no less than £150: and to allow
above £200 were superfluous and to his hurt. The ordinary
rate of his expense is 10 gold crowns a month his fencing, as
much his dancing, no less his reading, and 10 crowns monthly
his riding except in the heat of the year. The remainder of his
£150, I allow him for apparell, books, travelling charges, tennis
play, and other extraordinary expenses."</p>

<p>Some of the more studious travellers resorted to one or other
of the French universities. John Palsgrave and John Eliote,
the two best known English teachers of French in the sixteenth
century, had both followed this course. Palsgrave was a
graduate of Paris, and John Eliote, after spending three years
at the College of Montague in Paris, taught for a year in the
Collège des Africains at Orleans. The religious question had
much influence in determining the plan of study in France.
The university towns of Rheims and Douay were the special
resorts of English Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> On the suppression of the
religious houses in England and the persecution of the English
Roman Catholics, English seminaries arose at Paris, Louvain,
Cambrai, St. Omer, Arras, and other centres in France.
English Roman Catholics flocked to the French universities
and colleges, and there is in existence a long list of English
students who matriculated at the University of Douay.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the schools,<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> colleges,<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> and academies<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
founded by the Huguenots offered many attractions to
Protestant England. The colleges had much in common
with the modern French lycée, and the chief subjects taught
were the classical languages. They did not take boarders,
with the exception of that at Metz, and the students lived <i>en
pension</i> with families in the town. The same is true of the
academies, institutions of university standing. They were
eight in number, and situated at Nîmes, Montpellier, Saumur,
Montauban, Die, Sedan, Orthez (in the principality of Béarn<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>),
and Geneva. Some Englishmen and many Scotchmen<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">-233-</a></span>positions in the Protestant colleges and academies.
<span class="sidenote">BRITISH STUDENTS AT FRENCH UNIVERSITIES</span>Many
English Protestants, during their enforced sojourn on the
Continent during the reign of Mary, took advantage of their
exile to study at one or other of the Protestant academies,
as well as to perfect their knowledge of French. A great
number flocked to Geneva, including the Protestant author
Michael Cope, who frequently preached in French.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>Of the colleges, that of Nîmes attracted a large number
of foreigners. Montpellier likewise was very popular during
the short period at the beginning of the seventeenth century
when the town was Protestant. Among the academies in
France, Saumur, Montauban,<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> and Sedan were much frequented
by English travellers. Saumur in particular quickly
attained to celebrity; its rapid growth may be partly
accounted for by the fact that Duplessis Mornay, Governor of
the town in 1588, naturally became a zealous patron of the
Academy. Three years after its foundation the number of
foreign students was considerable, and throughout the seventeenth
century students from England, Scotland, Holland,
and Switzerland thronged to the town.</p>

<p>The Academy at Geneva likewise was very popular.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
Though not French, it was largely attended by French
students, who had some influence in raising the standard of the
French spoken in the town, which was rather unsatisfactory
in the sixteenth century. It greatly improved in the following
century, and when the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes
(1685), which dealt the death-blow to the French Protestant
foundations, drove many students to Geneva, their influence in
all directions was still more strongly felt. Some years before,
in 1654, the regents were enjoined to see to it that their pupils
"ne parlent savoyard et ne jurent ou diabloyent," but in 1691
Poulain de la Barre, a doctor of the Sorbonne, could say that
"à Geneve on prononce incomparablement mieux que l'on ne
fait en plusieurs provinces de France."<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p>The Protestant academies usually consisted of faculties of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">-234-</a></span>Arts and Theology. At Geneva<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> there were lectures in Law,
Theology, Philosophy, Philology, and Literature; the teaching
was chiefly in Latin, but sometimes in French. At the end
of the sixteenth century a riding school, known as the <i>Manège
de la Courature</i>, on the same lines as the polite academies of
France, was started. The instruction given at Geneva was
on broader lines than that of the less popular academies.
Nîmes and Montpellier, for instance, were mainly theological.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>Of the many Englishmen who went to Geneva, as to other
Protestant centres, not all attended lectures at the Academies.
Some went merely to learn French, "the exercises and assurance
of behaviour," as the general belief in England was
that they did so with less danger in the towns tempered
by a Calvinistic atmosphere. Among the Englishmen who
visited Geneva in the sixteenth and early seventeenth century
we find the names of Henry Withers, Roger Manners, fifth
Earl of Rutland, Robert Devereux, third Earl of Essex, the
son of Elizabeth's unfortunate favourite, and others. Thomas
Bodley, the celebrated founder of the Oxford Library, followed
all the courses at the University in 1559. It was considered
a great honour to lodge in the house of one or other of the
professors; Anthony Bacon, the elder brother of the great
Bacon, had the good fortune to be received into the house of
de Bèze. Casaubon likewise received into his house certain
young gentlemen who came to the town with a special recommendation
to him. These included the young Henry Wotton,
then on the long tour on the Continent, during which he
acquired the remarkable knowledge of languages which
qualified him for the position of ambassador which he subsequently
occupied. In 1593 Wotton wrote to Lord Zouch:
"Here I am placed to my great contentment in the house of
Mr. Isaac Casaubon, a person of sober condition among the
French." The learned professor soon became very fond of
Wotton, so far as to allow him to get into debt for his board
and lodging, and the young man left Geneva without paying
his debts, leaving Casaubon to face his numerous creditors
in the town. Casaubon was in despair; but fortunately the
episode ended satisfactorily, for Wotton lived up to his
character, and paid his debts in full as soon as he was able.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">-235-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">THE AFFECTED TRAVELLER</span>

When later Casaubon was at Paris (1600-1610) and his fame
was widespread, most travellers and scholars passing through
the city seized any opportunity of visiting him. Coryat
relates his visit to the great humanist as the experience he
enjoyed above all others. Lord Herbert of Cherbury was
also among the English travellers received by Casaubon into
his house at this period. "And now coming to court,"
writes Lord Herbert, "I obtained licence to go beyond sea,
taking with me for my companion Mr. Aurilian Townsend ...
and a man to wait in my chamber, who spoke French, two
lacqueys and three horses.... Coming now to Paris through
the recommendation of the Lord Ambassador I was received
to the house of that incomparable scholar Isaac Casaubon,
by whose learned conversation I much benefited myself.
Sometimes also I went to the Court of the French King
Henry IV., who, upon information of me in the Garden of
the Tuileries, received me with much courtesy, embracing
me in his arms, and holding me some while there."<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>By the side of the serious traveller we are introduced to the
frivolous type, travelling merely as a matter of fashion. These
"idle travellers," as they were called, were the cause of most
of the objections raised against the journey to France and the
longer tour on the Continent&mdash;apart from questions of religion
and politics. Few such travellers "scaped bewitching passing
over seas."<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> When Lord Herbert of Cherbury arrived
in Paris he remarked on the great number of Englishmen
thronging about the ambassador's mansion. They had, most
of them, studied the language and fashions in some quiet
provincial town, such as Orleans or Blois, and returned to
Paris full of affectations. Herbert draws a picture<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> of one
such "true accomplish'd cavalere":</p>

<p>Many travellers did not follow Moryson's advice "to lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">-236-</a></span>aside the spoone and forke of Italy, the affected gestures of
France, and all strange apparrell" on their return to England.
Their affectation of foreign languages and customs proved
disagreeable to many of their countrymen. The Frenchified
traveller and his untravelled imitators were known as <i>beaux</i>
or <i>mounsiers</i>. Nash speaks of the "dapper mounsieur pages
of the Court," and Shakespeare of the young gallants who
charm the ladies with a French song and a fiddle, and fill the
Court with quarrels, talks, and tailors.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> When the English

French in eating, drinking, yea in French vices and brages, so
that all estates of England were by them laughed at."</p>

<p>The English <i>beau</i> thought it his duty to despise English
ways, fashions, and speech, and to ape and dote upon all
things French:<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>There were two very different attitudes towards the journey
to France, as there were two types of traveller, the serious and
the flippant. The prejudiced and insular-minded asked with
Nash:<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> "What is there in France to be learned more than in
England, but falsehood in fellowship, perfect slovenry, to love
no man but for my pleasure, to swear <i>Ah par la mort Dieu</i>
when a man's hands are scabbed. But for the idle traveller
(I mean not for the soldier), I have known some that have
continued there by the space of half a dozen years, and when
they come home, they have hid a little weerish lean face under
a broad hat, kept a terrible coil in the dust in the street in
their long cloaks of gray paper, and spoke English strangely.
Nought else have they profited by their travel, save learned to
distinguish the true Bordeaux grape and know a cup of neat
Gascoigne wine from wine of Orleans." The opposite view is
expressed in the message George Herbert sent to his brother
at Paris:<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> "You live in a brave nation, where except you
wink, you cannot but see many brave examples. Bee covetous
then of all good which you see in Frenchmen whether it
be in knowledge or in fashion, or in words; play the good
marchant in transporting French commodities to your own
country."</p>

<h3>THE STUDY OF FRENCH AMONG MERCHANTS AND SOLDIERS</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Merchants</span>, always a very important and influential class in
England, claim a place by the side of the higher classes as
learners of French. They were continually in need of foreign
languages, and French was certainly the most useful, and, for
those trading with France and the Netherlands, quite indispensable.
As to their own language, we are told that
when English merchants were out of England "it liketh them
not, and they do not use it."<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> Those sons of gentlemen and
others who wished to engage in trade were usually apprenticed
to merchants. For instance, Sir <ins title="original: Willam">William</ins> Petty (b.
1623) first went to school where he got a smattering of Latin
and Greek, and, at the age of twelve, was bound apprentice
to a sea captain. At fifteen he went to Caen in Normandy
aboard a merchant vessel, and began to trade there with
such success that he managed to maintain and educate
himself. He learnt French and perfected himself in Latin,
and had enough Greek to serve his turn. Thence he travelled
to Paris and studied anatomy.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Sylvester, no doubt, had
many opportunities of putting to the test the French he
first learnt in Saravia's school when later in life he became
a merchant adventurer. It appears that many merchants
belonged to the class of travellers who picked up the language
abroad by mixing with those who spoke it. Fynes Moryson
accuses merchants, women, and children of neglecting any
serious study of languages and "rushing into rash practice."
"They doe many times," he admits, "pronounce the tongue
and speake common speeches more gracefully than others,
but they seldome write the tongue well, and alwaies forget
it in short time, wanting the practice." The many practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">-240-</a></span>little manuals of conversation which had appeared in the
Middle Ages, and the "litle pages set in print without rules or
precepts" which succeeded them, would certainly encourage
this "rushing into rash practice"; such, indeed, was their
aim. The majority of merchants acquired their French, we
may be sure, either by the help of such little handbooks,
intended to be learnt by heart, or simply by "ear."</p>

<p>Dialogues for merchants are provided in almost all French
text-books of the time, giving phrases for buying and selling
and enquiring the way. Barclay describes his grammar (1521)
as particularly useful to merchants. There was, moreover, a
very popular little book specially intended for that class&mdash;<i>A
plaine pathway to the French Tongue, very profitable for
Marchants and also all other which desire the same, aptly
devided into nineteen chapters</i>, which appeared first in 1575,
and in at least one,<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> and probably several other editions.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
The aim of the book would explain how it has come about
that only one copy has survived the wear and tear of the
demands made upon it. Again James Howell dedicated his
edition of Cotgrave's dictionary (1650) to the nobility and
gentry, and to the "merchant adventurers as well English
as the worthy company of Dutch here resident and others to
whom the language is necessary for commerce and foren
correspondence." Books such as those of Holyband and Du
Ploich were written for the use of the middle class, and, no
doubt, for merchants also; and a later writer, John Wodroeph,
describes his collection of common phrases as "more
profitable for the merchants than for the loathsome curtier
who cannot digest such coarse meats."</p>

<p>Dutch merchants are mentioned by Howell in the dedication
of Cotgrave's dictionary, and the close relations, existing
between England and the Netherlands in the time of
Elizabeth, possibly account for the fact that the Netherlanders
took some part in instructing the English, chiefly
merchants, in the French tongue. It has already been
seen how unfavourably the Huguenot teachers in England
criticized their fellow-teachers of French from the Low
Countries, and we are not surprised to find that the latter
contented themselves with teaching the language orally, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">-241-</a></span>avoided the risk of committing their views to paper.
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH TEXT-BOOKS FOR MERCHANTS</span>In the
Netherlands, however, no such compunction was felt, and
some manuals composed there made their way to England.
At an early date one was reprinted in London. Holyband,
the chief of the group of Huguenot teachers, was quickly up
in arms against it. "Je ne diray rien," he writes in
1573, "d'un nouveau livre venu d'Anvers, et dernierement
imprimé à Londres, à cause que, ne gardant ryme ne raison,
soit en son parler, phrase, orthographe, maniere de converser
et communiquer entre gens d'estat; et cependant
qu'il pindarise en son iargon il monstre de quel cru il est sorti,
que si nos chartiers d'Orleans, Bourges ou de Bloys avoyent
oui gazouiller l'autheur d'icelluy, ilz le renvoyeroient bailler
entre ses geais, apres luy avoir donné cinquante coups de leur
fouet sur ses échines." Let this writer teach his jargon to
the Flemings, the Burgundians, and the people of Hainault;
it is a true saying that a good Burgundian was never a good
Frenchman. "Lesquelles choses <ins title="original: considererées">considerées</ins>," concludes
the irate Holyband, "i'espere que l'autheur de ce beau livre
ne nous contraindra point de manger ses glands, ayans
trouvé le pur froment."</p>

<p>What was this book newly come from Antwerp? Probably
an edition of a very popular collection of phrases and conversations,
written originally in French and Flemish in the early
years of the sixteenth century, by a schoolmaster of Antwerp,
Noel de Barlement or Barlaiment.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> By the middle of the
century the work had appeared in four languages. In 1556
it was printed at Louvain in Flemish, French, Latin, and
Spanish, and in 1565 it appeared at Antwerp in Flemish,
French, Italian, and Spanish. In 1557 a London printer,
Edward Sutton, received licence to print "a boke intituled
Italian, Frynshe, Englesshe and Laten,"<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> and in 1568 a
"boke intituled Frynsche, Englysshe and Duche" was
licensed to John Alde.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Both of these volumes, we may
safely conclude, were adaptations of the Flemish handbook,
and either may have been the "book from Anvers" reviled
by Holyband. Another English edition of the work was
issued in 1578, a few years after Holyband's attack, by George
Bishop, who received licence to print a <i>Dictionarie colloques
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">-242-</a></span>ou dialogues en quattre langues, Fflamen, Ffrançoys, Espaignol
et Italien</i>, "with the Englishe to be added thereto."<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>This vocabulary of Barlement probably enjoyed considerable
popularity in England in its foreign editions also. It
was widely used by English merchants and travellers after
it had been adapted to their use by the addition of English
to its columns; and they would, no doubt, bring copies back
with them from the Netherlands. The earliest edition in
which English has a place was probably that of 1576, entitled
<i>Colloques or Dialogues avec un Dictionaire en six langues,
Flamen, Anglois, Alleman, François, Espagnol et Italien.
Tres util a tous Marchands ou autres de quelque estat qu'ils
soyent, le tout avec grande diligence et labeur corrigé et mis
ensemble.</i> <i>A Anvers 1576</i>. By the end of the century a
seventh and finally an eighth language were added. There
are copies of two further editions of the work issued in
England in the first half of the seventeenth century. The
first included four languages and appeared in 1637, under
the title of <i>The</i> <span class="combination"><span class="moustache">{</span>
<span class="above"><i>English French</i></span><span class="below"><i>Latine Dutch</i></span>
 <span class="moustache">}</span></span> <i>Scholemaster or an introduction to teach young Gentlemen and Merchants to travell or trade. Being the only helpe to attaine to those languages</i>.
It was printed
for Michael Sparke, who issued another edition in eight
languages in 1639 as <i>New Dialogues or colloquies or a little
Dictionary of eight languages. A Booke very necessary for all
those that study these tongues either at home or abroad, now
perfected and made fit for travellers, young merchants and seamen,
especially those that desire to attain to the use of the Tongues.</i>
Michael Sparke recommends the convenience of this portable
little volume: "And if parents use to send their children beyond
the sea to learne the language and to gaine the learning of
forraine nations, judge what may be said of the benefit of this
booke (I had almost said of the necessity of it) which being
read doth by daily experience furnish the Reader with a full
and perfect knowledge of divers tongues." He also tells you
"in your eare" that "since the worke has been published in
England and the Netherlands," not so perfect an edition has
appeared.</p>

<p>Turning to the contents of the little handbook, we are at
once struck by the close resemblance between its dialogues
and those of the French text-books produced in England&mdash;still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">-243-</a></span>further
<span class="sidenote">THE DIALOGUES OF BARLEMENT</span>evidence of the use of the book in our country.
Its contents, which in all the varied forms in which it appeared
are fundamentally the same, are divided into two parts.
The first consists of four chapters, and opens with table talk
very similar to that of the English-French dialogues, especially
those of Du Ploich. There is a passage, for example, in which
the schoolboy speaks of his school, found in varying form in
several of the early manuals produced in England:</p>

<p>The second chapter deals with buying and selling; the
third with counting, demanding payment of debts, and so
on; and the fourth gives specimens of commercial letters
and documents. The second part contains an alphabetical
vocabulary of common words, followed by directions for
reading and speaking French, in the guise of a slight grammar.
A few rules for pronunciation and the different parts of speech
are accompanied by advice to seek fuller information in other
French grammars. Then come a few rules for the other
languages&mdash;Italian, Spanish, and Flemish.</p>

<p>So popular was this handbook in England that it was
reprinted without much alteration, and no modernization,
at the beginning of the nineteenth century: <i>The Dialogues
in six languages Latin, French, German, Spanish, Italian,
and English</i>, appeared at Shrewsbury in 1808. We are
informed that "this book contains common forms of speach,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">-244-</a></span>one being a literal translation of the other, and as near as the
idiom of the language will bear, so that they correspond almost
word for word, and will be found extremely useful for beginners."
The second part of the work, although mentioned
in the table of contents, is omitted.</p>

<p>A similar polyglot manual, which was probably less well
known in England, was the <i>Vocabulaire de six langues, Latin,
François, Espagniol, Italien, Anglois et Aleman</i>, printed at
Venice, probably in 1540&mdash;an enlarged edition of a vocabulary
in five languages (Antwerp, 1534, and Venice, 1537) in which
English had no place. This handbook passed through several
other editions,<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> and no doubt became fairly well known in
England through the intermediary of the numerous Italian
merchants who came to London, and the English traders and
travellers visiting Italy; editions which appeared at Rouen
in 1611 and 1625 would also be easily obtainable. The dictionary
is described as a very useful vocabulary for those
who wish to learn without going to school&mdash;artisans, women,
and especially merchants. The first part consists of a
vocabulary, arranged under fifty-five headings, dealing with
the usual subjects, beginning with the heavens; the second
contains a list of verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and
pronouns, together with a collection of phrases and idioms.
The interesting dialogue of the Flemish vocabulary is lacking.</p>

<p>In the second half of the sixteenth century there lived at
Antwerp a language master, Gabriel Meurier, who counted
many English among his pupils. Meurier was a native of
Avesnes in Hainault, where he was born in about 1530. But
for many years he taught languages&mdash;French, Spanish,
Flemish, and Italian&mdash;at Antwerp, which had by this time
supplanted Bruges as the chief trading centre of the Low
Countries. His pupils were largely merchants, and his first
work on the language, the <i>Grammaire françoise contenante
plusieurs belles reigles propres et necessaires pour ceulx qui
desirent apprendre la dicte Langue</i>, 1557,<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> was dedicated to
"Messeigneurs et Maistres, les gouverneurs et marchans
Anglois." In 1563 was issued at Antwerp another work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">-245-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">GABRIEL MEURIER</span>specially for the use of the English&mdash;<i>Familiare communications
no leasse proppre then verrie proffytable to the
Inglishe nation desirous and nedinge the ffrench language</i>,
dedicated to his most honoured lord, John Marsh, governor
of the English nation, and intended for the use of "Marchands,
Facteurs, Apprentifs, and others of the English nation."
These dialogues on subjects specially useful to merchants are
divided into seventeen chapters, giving familiar talk for the
members of the different trades with lists of their merchandise,
directions for travellers, the names of different artisans
and tradesmen, instructions for collecting debts, receiving
money and writing receipts. Meurier teaches his pupils
the words used daily by merchants at the Exchange, and
then the degrees of kinship, numbers, coins, the days
and feast days, the parts of the body and clothing, food
and table talk, and, finally, commercial notes and letters.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
Another edition of the book was published at Rouen in 1641,
being intended, in this case, to teach both French and English.
The title given to it was <i>A treatise for to learne to speake
Frenshe and Englishe together with a form of making letters,
indentures, and obligations, quittances, letters of exchange, verie
necessarie for all Marchants that do occupy trade or marchandise</i>.
Meurier also composed numerous other books which have no
direct bearing on the teaching of French to Englishmen.
They were almost all written for the use of merchants, whom
they sought to instruct in French and Flemish, and sometimes
in Spanish and Italian as well. That the English were always
in the author's mind is shown by the fact that he sometimes
explains pronunciation by comparison with English sounds.
He also did important lexicographical work. He prepared
French-Flemish vocabularies in 1562 and 1566, and in
1584 his French-Flemish Dictionary was published at Anvers.
This dictionary is said to have been one of the sources which
helped Cotgrave to compile his famous work, and Meurier
seems to have outdone the later writer in collecting rare and
obsolete words.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>There were thus many faculties for learning French in the
Netherlands. Francis Osborne wrote regarding the study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">-246-</a></span>French abroad:<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> "for the place I say France, if you have a
purse, else some town in the Netherlands or Flanders, that is
wholesome and safe: where the French may be attained with
little more difficulty then at Paris, neither are the humours
of the people so very remote from your owne." Thus the
Netherlanders taught French to the English both in their own
country<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> and in England. The connexion was a long-standing
one. Caxton had taken his French and English Dialogues
from a Flemish text-book, and in later times, as has been seen,
Flemish works were published in England, and had some
influence on the dialogues of the English manuals of French.
The debt, however, was not all on one side. Holyband's
<i>French Schoolemaister</i>, for instance, was adapted to the use of
Flemings and printed at Rotterdam in 1606,<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> and in 1647 was
published at the end of the <i>Grammaire flamende et françoise</i>
(Rouen) of Jan Louis d'Arsy. Moreover, the grammar of
the seventeenth-century French teacher whose popularity
equalled that of Holyband in the sixteenth century&mdash;Claude
Mauger&mdash;was published in the Low Countries at
the same time as in England.</p>

<p>Another link between the teaching of French in the Netherlands
and in England is found in the book by John Wodroeph&mdash;an
interesting figure among teachers of French. He
spent many years in the Netherlands, and in his French text-book
he adapted what he called his "court and country dialogues"
from some French-Flemish ones written for the
instruction of the Court of Nassau in the former language.
Writing of the importance of a knowledge of French, he
emphasises its usefulness to the nobility. But, he adds, it is
still more profitable to merchants, for, excepting Latin, it is
the most widely used language in Christendom, and, "si j'osoye
dire," much more useful.</p>

<p>Wodroeph was a soldier, and soldiers, like merchants,
gave much impetus to the study of French. In Barlement's
book of dialogues, soldiers are ranked with merchants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">-247-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH IN MILITARY CIRCLES</span>travellers, and courtiers as those to whom the knowledge of
languages is most necessary: "soit que quelcun face merchandise
ou qu'il hante la court, ou qu'il suive la guerre, ou
qu'il aille par villes et champs." The wars raging almost
incessantly in France and the Low Countries attracted
numbers of Englishmen. The army was an opening for
younger sons, and so "Some to the wars to try their fortunes
there." Judging from the epigrams and satires of the time,
the swaggering gallant home from the wars was a familiar
figure in London. This sworded and martial <i>beau</i> is</p>

<p>Those who were moved by the spirit of adventure and liked
the picturesque crowded to the camp of Henry IV. of France
who counted many admirers in this country. One of these,
Dudley Carleton, afterwards Lord Dorchester, writes from
the king's camp in 1596 that he is busy studying French, though
"Mars leaves little room for Mercury." Later he perfected
his knowledge by studying at Paris, and wrote thence to John
Chamberlain, the letter writer, to tell him how one Sir John
Brooke, with Coppinger, a Kentish gentleman, "lately come
to learn the language," are the "logs in our French school."<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>
Unfortunately we have no more details of this little group of
Englishmen studying French at Paris. One of the Englishmen
who served in Normandy in 1591 with the troops sent by Queen
Elizabeth to help Henry IV. against the League kept a daily
journal from the 13th of August till the 24th of December
following.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> This soldier, Sir Thomas Coningsby, a friend of
Sir Philip Sidney, acted as muster master to the English
detachment, and was in frequent intercourse with Henry
before Rouen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">-248-</a></span>An interesting example of how the army and service
abroad offered opportunities for the study of French is found in
the memoirs of the Verney family. The three younger sons
of Sir Edmund Verney (1590-1642) all became soldiers.
Tom took service in the army of France, while Edmund
(1616-1649), after studying at Oxford, joined the army of
the States in Flanders (1640). When in winter quarters
at Utrecht, he "made up for his former idleness," and studied
for seven or eight hours a day for many months to improve
his knowledge of French and Latin. His Frenchman, he writes
to tell his father, is the same that was Sir Humphry Sidenham's;
he "warrants I shall speak it perfectly before we draw
into the field, and truly, I am confident I shall."<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> He was
reading Plutarch's <i>Lives</i> in French. Edmund was soon after
killed in the Civil War. His younger brother, Harry, was
intended from his youth for a soldier, and early sent to Paris
to study French. There he seems to have spoilt his English
without making any very rapid progress in French, for French
grammar had a powerful rival in horses and dogs&mdash;his chief
interest in life. "Pleade for me in my behalfe to my father,"
he implores his eldest brother, "if I have not write in french
so well as he expects, but howsoever, I presume a line to
testifie some little knowledge in the same, and hope in time to
expresse myselfe more radier, as the old proverbe is ... <i>il fault
du temps pour apprendre</i>." Harry Verney later took part in
the Thirty Years' War, and was present at the recapture of
Breda by the Prince of Orange in 1637.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>It was during the Thirty Years' War also that John Wodroeph
served in the Netherlands. He tells us in 1623 that he
had been "following the uncertaine warres" for "these seven
years past." During this period of service, "by the spared
dayes and houres of (his) watch and guarde," he composed a
book for teaching French, to which he gave the title of <i>The
Spared Houres of a Souldier in his travells or The true Marrowe
of the French tongue</i>. It was printed at Dort, near Rotterdam,
in 1623, and dedicated to the Prince of Wales, afterwards
Charles I. Wodroeph was a "gentleman," and we gather
from the interest he shows in Scotland that he hailed from
that country. At both the beginning and the end of his book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">-249-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">JOHN WODROEPH</span>are several poems of all sorts dedicated to courtiers who
had followed James from Scotland to England&mdash;the Duke of
Lennox, Earl Ramsey, James, Lord of Hay, and others. He
also addresses the Elector Palatine and his queen, Elizabeth,
James I.'s daughter. Many other poems, some in French
and some in English, are written in honour of the Lords of
the States-General and of sundry Flemish gentlemen. All
these give this work, written in the midst of the British army
abroad, a strong local colour. In addition, Wodroeph wrote
poems to celebrate the virtues and learning of numerous
Scottish and English officers&mdash;Colonel William Brog, Colonel
Robert Henderson, Captain Roger Orme, Captain Edwards,
Captain Drummond, and John Monteith, his very kind
captain. To many of these and other "sons of gentlemen"
Wodroeph had taught French, when his military duties
permitted, and he mentions Captain Drummond as being
among his most enthusiastic pupils. He also addresses lines
to his very good friend John Cameron, the Scotch theologian
and the minister of the French Church at Bordeaux, one of the
many Scotchmen who held important scholastic positions in
France. These verses must have been written between 1608
and 1617, the period when Cameron was at Bordeaux. Later
Cameron became professor of divinity at Saumur and Montauban.
He spoke French with unusual purity, and also
wrote some of his theological treatises in French.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p>Apart from its martial atmosphere, this curious volume
has also a strong Calvinistic flavour, another indication of Wodroeph's
Scottish sympathies. He wrote many "godly songs"
in French, to be sung to various psalm tunes, and even introduced
the spirit into his grammar itself. His verbs are
"truly formed and constructed after the order of Geneva,
which retaineth alwaies entirely the true marrow, method
and rules of verbs, or any other part of speech, both in their
Bibles, Psalms, and other godly books: forsaking all new
corruptions, of poets, and other vaine toyes, threatening to
deface the old authority of the Orthographie." Moreover, a
godly gentleman, "maister John Douglas, minister of the
Word of God to the English and Scotch troopers within
Utrecht," persuaded him to undertake the translation into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">-250-</a></span>French of Sir William Alexander's <i>Doomesday</i>, which at
this date embraced four books or "houres," subsequently
extended to twelve. <i>Doomesday</i>, thought Wodroeph,
would be greatly "liked of in France, yea, even as well as a
second Du Bartas." He was, however, unable to complete
his task, "finding the style so excellent and so high, and also
somewhat harsh, to agree with French verse, because that our
English tongue (and chiefly by this extraordinary poet) can
affoorde more sense and matter with ten of its syllables than
ever I have been able to construe with twelve or thirteen
of the French. Therefore I was constrained to leave it off,
partly for want of tyme and commoditie, and partly that it
was so constrained." The one 'Houre' he completed was
included in his book, with an apology and the expression of the
hope that "any kind French poet would end out the rest,
and also help these few rude lines which are translated in
haste out of his week and shallow braine."</p>

<p>Wodroeph wrote French, both verse and prose, with
remarkable ease. In addition to the poems already mentioned,
there are many others scattered through his works.
One of these, "Chanson Spirituelle de la vie des vertueux
hommes," is written to the tune of Desportes' song, "O nuit,
jalouse nuit, contre moy conjurée." He tells us that whenever
possible he used French in correspondence in preference
to English. He spoke the language with equal fluency,
and assures us that he did so with greater facility than
English. He had not acquired this mastery of the language
without much study, but by "many cold winter nights sitting
at it," and by much practice. He appears to have been fairly
widely read in French literature, and shared the admiration
felt by many of his countrymen for Du Bartas and the
<i>Quatrains</i> of Pibrac.</p>

<p>Thus Wodroeph was perfectly conscious of the many
difficulties offered by the French language, and censured
in strong terms those who pretend to teach it in a short space
of time. "I have shamefully heard say a teacher (in my
tyme) that he could give rules, that any might read and write
and understand the French language in six weeks. O what
a weake ground should hee build therein! Yea not in sixteene
months, hee and his gentle teaching! Unlesse he dazell his eyes
much, and straine his memory out of her limits." At an
earlier date, Holyband had deplored the existence of the many
<span class="sidenote">METHOD OF STUDY</span>"thornie and inepte bookes" claiming to give a knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">-251-</a></span>
of the language, and Wodroeph, in his turn, shows the small
esteem in which he held the many "small wares" by which
it is impossible to prove a good speaker. He had seen very
many treatises on verbs, "confused (for want of space), confusing
those who read them," and so many pamphlets and books
making believe "by wordes rather than by effects that the
French tongue can be truly learned by the same." No doubt
most of these little pamphlets are among the many school-books
of which all trace has been lost. There is, however,
mention of one, <i>A shorte method for the Declyning of Ffrench
Verbes</i>, by J. S., licensed in 1623 to the printer, Richard Field.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>Wodroeph, therefore, earnestly begs the student of French
not to fancy he can "spare the marrow of his famous braines"
and pick French up by ear alone, as many seek to do. He
must, on the contrary, be prepared "to storm the citadel of
grammar, and do as the valiant captaine, that is to say,
besiege the strongest houldes which commande over the lesser
and weaker sort." "Loving Reader," he writes, "if I could
persuade thee to believe what profit the diligent and serious
Man doth reape learning the true methode of French Tongue
and what advantage he gaineth above him who thinketh to
obtaine the said Tongue by the eare only: truly thou wouldest
use thine earnest diligence and celeritie perusing these rules."
Otherwise learners will speak "scurvily, harshly and painfully,
that they make the Frenches take their sport at them, even
as the English do at the Welshes ... taking sometyme the
male for the female, and the hand for the foote; applying to
the woman that which should apply to the man: and to the
leg which ought apply to the arme: as <i>la garçon</i>, <i>le femme</i>,
<i>ma sieur</i>, and <i>mon dame</i>: ... O what language this is in
the eares of the Frenches! I think truely it should make
Père Coton him selfe to laugh at it, who said in a sermon (the
King and Queen present), that hee had neither sinned nor
laughed in fiftene yeares tyme, yea and any man else."
Verbs are a special difficulty, and there "be many that can
never speake true French for lack of knowing their methode.
For where it ought to be spoken thus: <i>Il y eut</i> or <i>il y avait
un homme là</i>, some will say <i>il fut</i>, <i>il estoit un homme là</i>. Fine
French! And so will the ignorant speake through all the
moodes and tenses, whereat the Frenches take often their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">-252-</a></span>sport." Thus those who have learnt no grammar "go
wallowing in the painefull and muddy mire of confused and
backward broyles, doubting and fearing (without any assurance)
what words to speak first in framing their phrases."</p>

<p>But Wodroeph, in spite of the great emphasis he laid on
the study of rules, fully recognizes the importance and value
of practice. "I do not meene (for all this)," he writes, "to
condemne common practice of the tongue by the eare, but
do praise both wayes; esteeming (nevertheless) the method
of the rules for the better and surer way, as I have certainlie
found (and many others), by myne owne experience practicing
them bothe." "Certes il vous faut parler tousiours," he
says, "soit-il ou en bien ou en mal." To make progress "il
vous faut frequenter, hanter, accoynter, accoster, discourir,
babiller, caquetter, baiser, lecher, parler hardiment et discretement,
aymer, rire, gausser, jouer, vous rejouir, et jouir de
leurs bonnes faveurs et graces: et principalement ès compagnies
honestes: asçavoir, parmi les seigneurs et Dames,
Damoiselles honestes, pudiques matrones, femmes et filles de
vertu et d'honneur; captaines et dignes chefs de guerre, là
où il y a tousiours quelque chose a esplucher, si c'est de leurs
prouesses, <ins title="original: entreprinses">entreprises</ins>, ou de leurs faicts heroiques et memorables
. . . sans vous esbahir pour le bruit non plus que fait
le bon cheval de trompette." Wodroeph doubtless based
his advice on his own experience. Moreover, a bold and
enterprising spirit has much to do with the successful study of
French: "si vous n'estes hardi prompt, diligent, et vigilent,
vous n'apprendrez pas la langue françoise par songe . . . mais
cela vient par grande peine, diligence et priere a Dieu. Certes, . . .
si un homme estoit marié a une femme françoise . . .
il me semble qu'il apprendroit plustost en disant, Mme, ou
m'amie, permettez moy que ie vous recerche en tout honeur
et mariage . . . a celle fin de vous faire ma chere moitié, et
fidele espouse: que par ce moyen, ie puisse et avoir vostre
alliance et apprendre vostre language, autrement, madame,
il me cousteroit beaucoup plus de temps, de peine et de mes
moyens."</p>

<p>Wodroeph's book for teaching French is one of the most
comprehensive. He assures the student that it lacks "nothing
to make him a perfect Frenchman but the birth and delygence
though he never read any other." It fills more than five
hundred folio pages. Putting his theories into practice, he
<span class="sidenote">"THE SPARED HOURES OF A SOULDIER"</span>begins with rules of pronunciation and grammar, "set downe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">-253-</a></span>
by God's helpe as I have practiced in my time and by the
tracke of best Authours, which have professed this tongue
heretofore." His debt to Holyband makes it evident that
he ranked the popular sixteenth-century teacher among these.
He would have the student pay special attention to three
things: first the pronunciation, which, as was usual, he
bases on comparison with English sounds; then the genders,
learning every noun with its article "to lead to the same in
right gender"; and, finally, and most important of all, the
verbs, which should be committed to memory. In his grammar
he follows the usual order, treating each part of speech in
turn. He endeavours to avoid all superfluous rules, fearing
the "loathsomeness of the unlearned."</p>

<p>The rules occupy about a hundred pages. Then follows a
most comprehensive collection of practical exercises, intended
for all sorts and conditions&mdash;courtiers, merchants, and the
middle classes, "the learned and the unlearned." The
dialogues are accompanied by a verbatim English translation.
In the introductory ones the reader is referred to the margin
for the pronunciation of the most difficult words, where it is
given in English spelling. The "true English phrase" is added
in the footnote where necessary. Wodroeph was strongly
in favour of sacrificing if need be the purity of the English for
the sake of rendering the meaning of the French clearer.
He did not pretend, he says, to teach his countrymen their
"own ornate English." "Verbatim, therefore, sometimes
must be had, because it is requisite that it should not always
be closed up in a phrase, but showed bare, as it fals very often:
then (nil thou wilt thou) thou must have a coat to cover it, that
is to say his true signification, or else thou must leave it, and
run to the Dictionarie, and dazle thy eyes there awhile, and
be even so wise as thou wast before; for sometymes they are
not to be found at all in it, and sometymes it will fall in some
tense of some mood which no Dictionarie can yield: yea even
thousands."</p>

<p>The first section of the dialogues, that accompanied by the
guides to pronunciation, deals with familiar subjects, more
useful than elegant and more profitable for the middle classes
and merchants than for the "loathsome courtier." "Thou
hast in this Booke all household stuffe and other pretty
necessary words meete for thy dailie use in this tongue. Also
an Introduction to frame all common and ordinarie phrases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">-254-</a></span>
pertaining to a house: as of victuals, dressing, voyaging
through the land. Also the partes and cloathing of a Man,
his body, all in remarkable phrases; whereof I will shew thee
vively, yea every Member, from the crowne of the Head unto
the Foot." Though Wodroeph's dialogues are on a much
larger scale than usual in French manuals, they treat of much
the same topics. He advises the student to read this first
set of dialogues several times, as much to get a good foundation
of common talk, as to learn the pronunciation by means of
the guides provided. They are followed by lists of common
phrases to be learnt by heart, "every day one or two, for
ordinarie use," and to facilitate an early use of French in
conversation, and also by French idioms "very necessary for
Translations of this tongue into any other."</p>

<p>After about sixty pages of this introductory matter we
pass to what Wodroeph calls "The first booke of familie
Dialogues, wherein is treated of all kinds of common necessary
phrases as well for the use of the fields, labourage and contries,
as for all sortes of home affaires for a house"&mdash;all accompanied
by a verbatim English translation. These dialogues comprise
conversations between members of most ranks of society,
from a king and queen, ladies and gentlemen, to family scenes,
and discussions between various tradesmen and peasants,
not forgetting the schoolmaster and his pupil and the military
officer and his subordinates; for, whenever occasion arises,
Wodroeph introduces military talk. This section of the
work closes with a list of the proper terms in which to address
the higher and lower classes.</p>

<p>Next come the dialogues taken from <i>Le verger des Colloques
recréatifs</i>, offered by a Walloon to Prince Henry of Nassau,
for his furtherance in the same tongue in his younger years.
Wodroeph claims to have purified this book, written in "scurvie
Wallons language." It had already been adapted to the
instruction of the English in the Italian language, by John
Florio in his <i>Second Frutes</i>. These dialogues are naturally
more of the courtly type, and are concerned with the daily
occurrences of the life of a gentleman.</p>

<p>They are followed by <i>The Springwell of Honour and Vertue</i>,
a collection of moral sayings and counsels, "composed both
by ancient and moderne philosophers not only for the benefit
of the corrupted youth, but also for all folkes, of all qualities,
and chiefly for the yong gentilitie." <span class="sidenote">END OF WODROEPH'S CAREER</span>Wodroeph explains how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">-255-</a></span>
this collection came to have a place in his book: "being
once invited to supper of a worthy and virtuous gentleman
(one who had showed me much favour for clearing his eldest
sone of some doubts of the French tongue), I saw that hee (his
owne selfe) did copie some Theames out of this same Worke ...
for to instruct one of his children being (for that present) at the
French schoole; I entreated him to lend it me for a Tyme,
who did it willingly until I had viewed it, and corrected the
French and read it all out." The <i>Springwell</i> is divided into
three bookes: the first deals with the "means of acquiring
Honour and Vertue"; the second with the old subject of the
six or, as Shakespeare has it, seven ages of man; and the third
with the worship of God and our duty to our neighbours.</p>

<p>After sundry poems, addressed to English, Scottish, and
Flemish gentlemen, and the translation of Sir William
Alexander's <i>First Hour</i>, given in both French and English,
come directions for writing letters, with thirty-six epistles in
French and English, and themes gathered out of French
authors for the use of some of his pupils, "before I made
them frame any letters: very profitable to begin with and out
of the best and purest French." Finally we have the usual
proverbs, so much in favour at this period, "picked" from
those of the learned Mathurin Cordier, and "sundry other
Authours and writers." The work closes with "a Thankesgiving
(of the Authour) unto God for his helpe in the finishing
of this worke," and the quotation of Wodroeph's device&mdash;"Vers
Dieu c'est le meilleur."</p>

<p>In 1625 a second edition of this curious volume appeared
in London, under the title of <i>The Marrow of the French Tongue</i>.
This edition is said to be "revised and purged of much gross
English" which had made its way into the former edition,
printed abroad. It is considerably abridged, and lacks the
living interest of the Dort edition. The actual instructions
for the French tongue remain intact, but all the little
chatty autobiographical scraps, and observations to the
"Loving Reader," as well as the addresses to officers, which
gave such a characteristic personal touch to the earlier edition,
are here omitted, and the work is about one hundred and
seventy pages shorter. The dedication to Charles Stuart,
now newly crowned Charles I., still stands. Wodroeph had
no doubt returned to England, where he was known to several
of the prominent men of the time. In 1623 he had mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">-256-</a></span>
favours received from James, Lord of Hay, at Hampton Court,
sixteen years before. We may presume that he continued to
teach French among the higher classes of society after his
return, though there does not appear to be any further trace
of him.</p>

<h3>FRENCH AT THE COURTS OF JAMES I. AND CHARLES I.&mdash;FRENCH
STUDIED BY THE LADIES&mdash;FRENCH PLAYERS
IN LONDON&mdash;ENGLISH GENERALLY IGNORED BY
FOREIGNERS</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> coming of the Stuarts strengthened considerably the
connexion between France and England. French was widely
used at the Court of James I. The King himself does not
appear to have been well acquainted with other foreign
languages than French and Latin, both of which he employed
freely in conversation<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> and correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> In one or other
of these tongues he conversed with the learned foreigners he
loved to gather at his Court, such as Isaac Casaubon<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> and
the famous Protestant preacher, Pierre Du Moulin, minister
of Charenton. The latter has left an account<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> of the warm
welcome he received from the English monarch; he tells us
that at meal times he usually stood behind His Majesty's
chair and conversed with him. James requested Du Moulin
to write an answer to Cardinal Du Perron's pamphlet concerning
the power of the Pope over monarchs, in which he
had been attacked. Du Moulin complied, and his work was
printed at London in 1615 as the <i>Declaration du Sérénissme
Roy Jacques I</i>. He also preached in French before James
at the Chapel Royal at Greenwich, and received marks of
distinction from the University of Cambridge, which conferred
the degree of D.D. upon him.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">-260-</a></span>An idea of the extent to which French was used in intercourse
with ambassadors and other foreigners may be gathered
from the <i>Finetti Philoxenus</i>, a series of observations by Sir
John Finett, knight and master of the ceremonies to the
two first Stuart kings of England, touching the reception and
precedence, treatment and audience of foreign ambassadors.
The French language was making important progress at this
time, and Latin was rapidly losing ground. James was the
last king of England to employ Latin in familiar conversation,
and this is partly accounted for by his pedantic turn of mind.
The spread of the use of French in England was hastened too
by its growing popularity all over Europe. The Flemish
Mellema, in his Flemish-French Dictionary of 1591, says
French is used everywhere in Europe and the East.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> To be
unacquainted with French was accounted a great deficiency
in a gentleman. It was said of the language that <i>qui
langue a jusqu'à Rome va</i>,<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> and in England the general
conviction was that "No nobleman, gentleman, soldier, or
man of action in business between Nation and Nation can
well be without it."<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>James seems to have acquired his knowledge of French
chiefly by means of intercourse with the many Frenchmen
at the Scottish Court, one of whom, Jérôme Grelot, was among
the young noblemen who shared his studies.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> He also read
much French literature, however, and later took a great
interest in the language studies of his children. They were
constantly required to send him letters in French and Latin
to allow him to judge of their progress.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sir," wrote the Princess Elizabeth, afterwards Queen of Bohemia,
"L'esperance que j'ay de vous voir bien tost et d'avoir l'honneur de recepvoir
voz commandemens m'empeschera de vous faire ma lettre plus longue
que pour baiser tres humblement les mains de vostre Majesté."<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p></div>

<p>The king's eldest son, Henry, made acquaintance with
French at a very early age. In 1600, when only seven years
old, he addressed a letter in French to the States-General of
Holland. He calls this epistle "les primices de nostre main,"<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
and probably received some help in its composition. He also
wrote in French to Henry IV., who had recommended to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">-261-</a></span>his riding master,
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH STUDIES OF THE STUART FAMILY</span>M. St. Antoine,<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> and to the Dauphin, offering
him two <i>bidets</i>.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
At this time many of the riding-masters
in England were Italians, but almost all the dancing-masters
were Frenchmen.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> The young prince, however, had a French
master for both these exercises.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> One of his language masters
was John Florio, best known by his translation of Montaigne's
<i>Essais</i>, published in 1600, who taught both French and Italian
and was the author of several books for teaching the latter.
Florio had spent many of his earlier years at Oxford, and at
the beginning of the seventeenth century was in London,
teaching languages, and well acquainted with many of the
chief men of the day. It is uncertain at what date he
became tutor to Prince Henry,<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> but in 1603 he was appointed
Reader in Italian to Queen Anne, and in the following year
"Gentleman extraordinary and Groom of the Privy Chamber."
His royal pupil was a great lover of Pibrac's <i>Quatrains</i>, popular
among teachers of French. The prince wrote to his mother
in 1604, sending her a copy of one of the quatrains, and telling
her that if she likes he will undertake to learn the whole by
heart before the end of the year; and, in reminding his father
of a promise to give ecclesiastical preferment to his tutor,
Mr. Adam Newton, he quotes one of them as appropriate:<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>Prince Charles, afterwards Charles I., seems to have been
the most accomplished of James's family in so far as French is
concerned. He was able to carry on a conversation in it with
his father and the Duke John Ernest of Saxe-Weimar when
he was thirteen years old.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> Evidence of his fluency is provided
by the well-known episode of his visit to Spain to see the
Infanta. The Queen of Spain, daughter of Henry IV. and
sister of Henrietta Maria, was delighted when the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">-262-</a></span>prince, on his arrival at the Spanish Court, addressed her in
her native idiom. She warned him not to speak to her again
without permission, as it was customary to poison all gentlemen
suspected of gallantry towards the Queen of Spain. She
managed to obtain leave to speak with Charles, however, and
had a long conversation with him in her box at the theatre, in
the course of which, it is said, she confided to him her desire
for his marriage with her sister.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> When Charles married
Henrietta she was quite ignorant of English, and his knowledge
of French was again put to the test. He was also called upon
to employ French with his mother-in-law, Marie de Medecis,
during her stay in England. His letters to her show how
accomplished a writer of French he was. He possessed a more
elegant style than his French wife, thanks largely to Guy Le
Moyne,<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> who was also French tutor to the Duke of Buckingham<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>
and other members of the nobility.</p>

<p>Among the French masters employed in the family of
Charles I. was Peter Massonnet, a native of Geneva, who
attended the princes, Charles (II.) and James (II.), in the
capacity of sub-tutor, writing-master, and French teacher.
We have no details as to how he taught them, nor do we know
if Charles learnt from one or other of the French manuals
which had been dedicated to him. Massonnet received a
salary and pension from Charles I., in whose service he remained
for thirty-two years, first as French tutor to his children and
then, in the time of his adversity, as clerk to the Patents, and
Foreign Secretary. During the Commonwealth he spent some
time at Oxford, and was created D.Med. on the 9th of April
1648, being described as second or under tutor to James,
Duke of York.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> At the time of the Restoration Massonnet
was in a very destitute condition. His pension had not been
paid during the troubled period of the Civil Wars and the
Commonwealth, and to crown all he was outlawed for
debt. He had to petition Charles II., his former pupil,
several times for the payment of his salary and arrears
before his appeal had any real effect. From time to time
he received instalments, but in 1668 he was still "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">-263-</a></span>saddest
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH TUTORS AT COURT</span>object of pity of all the king's servants, and ready
to perish."<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>In 1633 Sir Robert le Grys, Groom of the Chamber to
James I. and Charles I.,<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> offered his services as tutor to Prince
Charles (II.), then three years old. He undertook to make
Latin the prince's mother tongue by the age of seven, using
an easy method, not "dogging his memory with pedantic
rules, after the usual fashion." French was to be the language
first studied, and Italian and Spanish also entered the programme.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
What sort of reception these proposals met with
is not known, but in May of the same year Sir Robert was
granted the office of captain of the Castle of St. Mewes for
life.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Another tutor, named Lovell, taught French and
Latin to two of Charles I.'s children during the Civil War.
He was employed at Penhurst by the Countess of Leicester,
to whose care the children had been committed.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>Ladies were among the most eager lovers of the French
language at the Court of the early Stuarts, and were noted for
their proficiency in that tongue. We hear that wealthy
ladies go to Court, "and there learn to be at charge to teach
the paraquetoes French."<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> Not only was he that could not
<i>parlee</i> not considered a gentleman, but the ladies had to
talk French if they wished to play a part at Court. French
had entirely supplanted Euphuism, the high-flown, bombastic
speech which had held sway in polite circles after the appearance
of Lyly's <i>Euphues</i> in 1579. "Now a lady at Court who
speaks no French," wrote Th. Blount in 1623,<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> "is as little
regarded as she who did not parley euphuisme" in the earlier
days. Girls, to be considered well brought up, had to "speak
French naturally at fifteen, and be turned to Spanish and
Italian half a year later."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> It is improbable that Spanish was
learnt in any but a few exceptional cases. Italian, however,
was fairly widely learnt for purposes of reading as we may
conclude from the title of a book printed at London in 1598
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">-264-</a></span>by Adam Islip&mdash;<i>The Necessary, Fit and Convenient Education
of a young Gentlewoman, Italian, French, and English</i>.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
John Evelyn's favourite daughter, Mary, was as familiarly
acquainted with French as with English. Her knowledge of
Italian was limited and characteristic of the general attitude
taken up towards that language; she understood it, and was
able "to render a laudable account of what she read and
observed." His other daughter, Susanna, was also a good
French scholar, but apparently knew no Italian, though she
had read most of the Greek and Roman authors. Sir Ralph
Verney, who dissuaded women from deep study, recognised
that French was indispensable, and encouraged them to read
French romances especially.</p>

<p>While Italian was sometimes read, French was almost
always spoken in polite circles. Milton's avowed preference
for Italian forms a noticeable exception to the general
rule, and even he acquired some knowledge of French at
an early age.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> There were also many more facilities for learning
French than there were for Italian. It is certain&mdash;some
of the dialogues of the French text-books prove it&mdash;that many
ladies picked up a conversational knowledge of the language
from their French maids. This was how the young daughters
of Lord Strafford acquired their knowledge, as we see from
the following account of their progress which he sent to their
grandmother: "Nan, I think, speaks French prettily ...
the other (Arabella) also speaks, but her maid, being of
Guernsey, her accent is not good."<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>Women, however, had had at all times no small influence
on the production of French text-books. One of the first
written in England, the <i>Treatyz</i> of Walter de Bibbesworth,
was composed in the first place for the use of Lady Dionysia
de Mounchensy. The two chief grammars of the early sixteenth
century, the <i>Introductorie</i> of Duwes and the <i>Esclarcissement</i>
of Palsgrave, both owed their origin to royal princesses,
and early in the seventeenth century there appeared a grammar
written specifically to enable women to "match old
Holliband" and "<i>parlee</i> out their part" with men&mdash;<i>The
French Garden for English Ladyes and gentlewomen to walke
in, or a Summer dayes labour</i>, by Peter Erondell or Arundell,

<span class="sidenote">LADIES STUDY FRENCH</span>a native of Normandy, and one of the group of refugee
Huguenots, who taught the French language in London.
Erondell informs us he had long felt the urgent need of
such a book in his own teaching experience. "It is to be
wondered," he writes, "that among so many which (and
some very sufficiently) have written principles concerning our
French Tongue (making the dialogues of divers kinds), not
one hath set forth any respecting or belonging properly to
women, except in the French Alphabet,<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> but as good never a
whit as never the better; not that I finde faulte with it, but
it is so little, as not to contayne scarce a whole page, so that
it is to be esteemed almost as nothing. I knowe not where
to attribute the cause, unles it be to forgetfulnes in them that
have written of it. For seeing that our tongue is called
<i>Lingua Mulierum</i>, and that the English ladyes and gentlewomen
are studious and of a pregnant spirits, quicke concertes
and ingeniositie, as any other country whatsoever, me thinketh
it had been a verie worthie and specious subject for a good
writer to employ his Pen." Accordingly Erondell undertook
"to break the yce first," as he puts it.</p>

<p>He opens his <i>Garden</i> with some rules of pronunciation in
English, "as a gate through the which wee must (and without
the which we cannot) enter into our French Garden." He
acknowledges that he has selected these rules "out of them
which have written thereof." Many are taken from De la
Mothe's <i>French Alphabet</i>, and Holyband, as well as Bellot, are
also reckoned amongst those "which have written best of it."
On one point, however, Erondell claims to make an observation
"never noted before in any book." This had to
do with the change in pronunciation of the diphthong <i>oi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
"Whereas our countrymen were wonte to pronounce these
words <i>connoistre</i> ... as it is written by <i>oi</i> or <i>oy</i>; now since
fewe yeeres they pronounce it as if it were written thus,
<i>conètre</i>."</p>

<p>Erondell reduces the grammar rules to the smallest possible
number. "He wishes the student to learn by heart"
the first two verbs <i>avoir</i> and <i>estre</i>, and for the rest to "help
him selfe by the treatise that M. Holliband made thereof,<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>
as being the best (French and English) that I have yet seen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">-266-</a></span>notwithstanding it is not amisse to make you knowe our
persons and the number of our conjugations, which M. Bellot,
in his <i>French Guide</i>,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> saith to be sixe, and I can number
no more." In dealing with grammar, Erondell claims to
correct a gross error common in England&mdash;the use of <i>de</i>
for the preposition <i>from</i> before a masculine noun preceded
by <i>le</i>; "because that in English it is said ... <i>I come from
the country</i>, so the English students do commonly say, insteade
of <i>Je viens du pays</i>, ... <i>Je viens de le pays</i>.... But why
should I finde faulte in the English students," says Erondell,
"whereas I my selfe have heard the French teachers (I mean
of our language) commit commonly that error?"</p>

<p>Erondell's grammar rules occupy but ten pages. They
contain a few observations on the gender and number of
nouns, on verbs, notes on <i>du</i>, <i>au</i>, <i>de la</i>, <i>a la</i>, <i>en</i>, <i>y</i>, and on the
negative and degrees of comparison. He considers that the
rules usually contained in French text-books are too many.
Except for a few indispensable rules, "without the which our
language can never be intelligiblie spoken," the rest are
"rather a trouble and discouragement to the student then
any furtherance." He compiled his book "for them of judgement
and capacity only, which may far sooner attaine to
the perfect knowledge of our tongue, by reason of cutting
off those over-many rules, wherein the student was overmuch
entangled." His first idea, indeed, had been to make a set
of dialogues for women without any rules, but he realised that
to do this would have been like building a "house without
a doore"; "and so, the gate being wider open, they may
walke in who will." Gentlemen also may find some
"flowers" to please them, and the garden is an "arbour for
the child":</p>

</div></div>

<p>The dialogues, thirteen in number, and all of considerable
length, form the main part of the work. As usual they are in
French and English, and, in addition, the pronunciation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">-267-</a></span>more
<span class="sidenote">PETER ERONDELL</span>difficult French words is given in English spelling in the
margin. They deal with the events in the daily life of a lady,
from her rising in the morning till bed-time. The first portrays
the lady, who is of a rather pedantic turn of mind, rising
and dressing. The second introduces her two daughters and
their French governess. There is much talk on the education
of children, and we are spectators of the French tutor's (Erondell)
arrival and of the French lesson, which forms the fourth
dialogue. Each of the two girls in turn reads in French and
then translates. The more advanced is given some English
to translate into French, and the beginner is asked to
conjugate certain French verbs. This is how the lesson opens:</p>

<div class="table">

</table></div>

<p class="noi">At the end of her lesson, Florimond has to point out
her younger sister's mistakes; for, says Erondell, "in
teaching others, one learns oneself." His rule for learning to
read was, "observe your rules and read as you do in English"&mdash;a
method which explains his system of guides to pronunciation.
From the dialogues the student passes to the reading
of French literature. The girls' French tutor came between
seven and eight in the morning, the dancing-master at nine,
the singing-master at ten, and another music-master at four in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>In the following dialogues the lady visits first the nursery,
and next her sons and their tutors. She is then pictured
receiving guests, going out shopping, presiding at the dinner-table,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">-268-</a></span>and taking part in the conversation. Finally, in the
evening, the company take a walk by the Thames, and the
thirteenth and last dialogue "treateth of going to bed,
prayers (including the Creed), and night-clothes."</p>

<p>In order to give students an introduction to French verse
as well as prose, Erondell adds to his book the story of the
Centurion in the New Testament put into French verse by
himself. He does not provide any English translation, and
considers that the pupil who has progressed so far in the
study of the language can very well do without it. For the
same reason he here omits, as he does in the last dialogue
also, the guides to pronunciation.</p>

<p>For a time Erondell had been tutor in the Barkley family,
and dedicated the <i>Garden</i> to the Lady Elizabeth Barkley,
with an expression of his gratitude for the many favours he
had received from her. The verses on the Centurion are
dedicated to Thomas Norton, of Norwood, whom he calls
his "très intime et très honoré amy." As was usual at this
time, Erondell's book is preceded by commendatory poems,
including lines by William Herbert, author of <i>Cadwallader</i>, and
by Nicholas Breton. There is also a sonnet by the "Sieur de
Mont Chrestien, Gentilhomme françois," possibly the famous
Antoine de Montchrétien, who in about 1605 was forced to
leave France on account of a duel, and visited both England
and Holland. Erondell appears to have been many years in
England before he produced his <i>Garden</i>. At this date he had
a large clientèle, including "many honourable ladies and
gentlemen of great worth and worship." In about 1613 he
engaged an assistant to help him, one John Fabre, a Frenchman,
"born in the precinct of Guyand, a town of Turnon";
in 1618 Fabre was still "professeing the teaching of the
French tongue with Mr. Peter Arundell."<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>In addition to compiling the <i>French Garden</i>, Erondelle prepared
four new editions of Holyband's <i>French Schoolemaister</i>.
Although they are said to be "newly corrected and emended
by P. Erondell," he made no noticeable changes. The first
of these editions appeared in 1606, and the others in 1612, 1615,
and 1619. This last date is the latest at which we hear of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">-269-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">ERONDELL'S WORKS</span>

The earliest notice we have of Erondell is found in 1586,
when he published a <i>Declaration and Catholic Exhortation to
all Christian Princes to succour the Church of God and Realme
of France</i>,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> faithfully translated out of French, and printed
side by side with the original&mdash;another of the many similar
pamphlets in French and English. He had thus been in
England at least twenty years when his book for teaching
French was published, and its tardy appearance led one of
his admirers to ask:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Swift Erondell, why hast thou been so slowe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose nature is to bring the summer in?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">In earlier years Erondell had no doubt made use of Holyband's
works; he evinces a high esteem for the sixteenth-century
teacher, and shows intimate acquaintance with his
<i>Schoolemaister</i> and his <i>Treatise on Verbs</i>. It is an interesting
fact that until the middle of the seventeenth century and
probably much later Holyband's sixteenth-century French
was still being taught in England; as late as 1677 the <i>French
Schoolemaister</i> was among the books advertised for sale by
Thomas Passenger at the sign of the Three Bibles on London
Bridge.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> The great changes taking place in the evolution of
the French language reached England but slowly.</p>

<p>Erondell translated another French work into English.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
One day Richard Hakluyt, the geographer, brought him the
whole volume of the Navigations of the French Nation to the
West Indies to translate. From this Erondell selected the
<i>Nova Francia, or the Description of that part of New France,
which is one continent with Virginia, described in the three late
voyages ... made by M. de Monto, M. du Pont Grave, and
M. de Poutrincourt, into the countries called by the French men
La Cadre, lying to the southwest of Cape Breton ...</i>, which was
published in 1609 and dedicated to the "Bright Starre of
the North, Henry, Prince of Great Britaine."</p>

<p>The arrival of the French Queen of England, Henrietta
Maria, in 1625, gave further stimulus to the already strong
French influence at the Court. When she came she knew no
English, and for many years after her arrival waywardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">-270-</a></span>refused to study the language. Her numerous suite of French
ladies and gentlemen, including Mme. Georges, the Duc and
Duchesse de Chevreuse, and Père Sancy, shared her ignorance,
as indeed did practically all foreigners. The English Court
was thus called upon to exercise its French to the uttermost.
The small French colony in London managed to make itself
very unpopular, not only with the King but also with the
whole Court. Their ignorance of English and English ways
caused them to commit blunders which prejudiced people
against them. Such was the case when Henrietta and her
suite strolled, chattering and making a great noise, through
an assembly of English people listening to a sermon. The
preacher asked if he must stop, but no notice was taken,
and soon the whole retinue returned in the same fashion,
evidently not understanding a word of what was going on.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
Within a year of their arrival, however, most of the French
attendants were dismissed.</p>

<p>Four years after the arrival of the French queen, who
had a passion for the theatre, a French company arrived in
London and acted before an English audience.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> They first
played a farce at Blackfriars on the 17th of November, but
did not meet with much success, being "hissed, hooted, and
pipinpelted." This hostile reception was partly due to the
fact that women<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> took part in the acting&mdash;a thing hitherto
unknown in England&mdash;and partly because the play was a
"lascivious and unchaste comedye," and the company was
formed of "certain vagrant French players who had beene
expelled from their owne country." No wonder that they
gave "just offence to all vertuous and well disposed
persons in the town." Yet the French actors were not
discouraged. They waited a fortnight, and then obtained a
licence to play at the Red Bull. This second attempt does
not appear to have been more successful than the first. After
some three weeks had elapsed, however, the company decided
to make a last effort. This time they acted at the Fortune,
but with so little success, that the Master of the Revels
refunded them half his fee "in respect of their ill-fortune."
The failure of the venture was due largely to its novelty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">-271-</a></span>and the popular dislike of the French. <span class="sidenote">FRENCH PLAYERS IN LONDON</span>Though we are told
that there was a "great resort" to the French plays,<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>
apparently people went more for the sake of rioting than
for the pleasure of hearing the French plays.</p>

<p>The stormy reception of 1629 did not, however, hinder
other French actors from coming to our country. In 1635
a new company arrived, this time under the special patronage
of the Queen.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> They first played before Her Majesty, who
recommended them to the King. Through his influence they
were allowed the use of the Cockpit Theatre in Whitehall.
There, on the 17th of February, they presented a French
comedy called <i>Mélise</i>&mdash;either Corneille's <i>Mélite</i>, or more
probably Du Rocher's comic pastoral, <i>La Mélize, ou les
Princes Reconnus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> The King, Queen, and Court were
present. The acting met with approval and the players
received £10. There was no repetition of the riotous
behaviour which had characterised the performances of 1629,
probably because there were no women in the company, and
also because the players were specially patronised by the
Court and the aristocracy. A few days after the King gave
orders to the Master of the Revels, Sir Henry Herbert,
brother of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, that the French
company should be allowed to act at Drury Lane Theatre
on the two sermon days of each week during Lent, and
through the whole of Passion week, when they would avoid
rivalry with Beeston's English players, who did not perform
on those days. Sir Henry Herbert, himself a good French
scholar, tells us he "did all these courtesies to the French
gratis," wishing to render the Queen his mistress an acceptable
service.</p>

<p>The French actors now enjoyed increasing popularity.
When, at the end of Lent, they had to relinquish the Cockpit,
Drury Lane, to the English players, their services were still
in demand. On Easter Monday they acted before the Court
in a play called <i>Le Trompeur puny</i>, no doubt the tragi-comedy
of that name by Georges de Scudéry.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Their success was
even greater than on the occasion of the Court performance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">-272-</a></span>of <i>Mélise</i>, and on the 16th of April following, they presented
<i>Alcimedor</i>,<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> under the same circumstances, and "with good
approbation." These three plays acted at the Court are the
only part of their repertoire that is named in the record of the
Master of the Revels. On the 10th of May they received £30
for three plays acted at the Cockpit, probably that in Whitehall,
where they first acted <i>Mélise</i> before the Court, nearly
four months earlier, and not the Cockpit, Drury Lane, where
they had played during Lent.</p>

<p>The question now arose of providing the French players
with a special theatre of their own. Arrangements were
made for converting part of the Riding School in Drury Lane
into a play-house, and on the 18th of April the King signified
to Sir Henry Herbert his royal pleasure that "the French
comedians should erect a stage, scaffolds and seats, and all
other accommodations." On the 5th of May following a
warrant was granted to Josias d'Aunay and Hurfries de Lau
(so Sir Herbert spells their names)<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> and others, empowering
them to act at the new theatre "during pleasure." How long
the French company, whose director was Josias Floridor,
continued to act in London is not known. But it is a striking
fact that in 1635 there was a regular French theatre established
in the city, and its presence must have had considerable effect.
The French company under Floridor again appeared before
the Court, in December 1635; we do not know what they
played, beyond the fact that it was a tragedy. On the twenty-first
of the same month, the Pastoral of <i>Florimène</i> was acted
in French at Whitehall by the French ladies who attended
the Queen. The King, the Queen, Prince Charles, and the
Elector Palatine, were present, and the performance was a
great success.</p>

<p>The Queen did not persist in her obstinate refusal to learn
English. When she had been in the country about seven
years, she began to study the language seriously. Mr. Wingate
was her tutor, and her love of the theatre was put
to practical use by the performance of long masques and
pastorals in English in which she took part. It is not surprising
that Henrietta Maria was ignorant of English, for our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">-273-</a></span>language was
<span class="sidenote">ENGLISH IGNORED ON THE CONTINENT</span>practically unknown in France in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. Italian and Spanish were the
fashionable modern foreign languages in France. English
was either entirely ignored or regarded as barbarous, and
since French was widely spoken at the English Court, and
Latin was used by scholars, the need for it was not felt.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
No foreign ambassador ever knew English. Of the Frenchmen
who visited England,<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> only a few learnt the language.
Chief among these were the French teachers, the pioneers
among Frenchmen in the study of the English tongue. Of
individuals, the Sieur de la Hoquette, man of letters and
traveller, is said to have visited England to see Bacon, and
learnt English in order to read the Chancellor's works in the
original. He discussed Bacon's works and English novels
with J. Bignon, and was surprised to find that scholar
acquainted with them. Jean Doujat also knew English,
as did La Mothe le Vayer, who married a Scotchwoman,
and also perhaps Regnier Desmarais, who draws a few comparisons
with it in his grammar.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> But these were isolated
exceptions. Among the languages in which Panurge addresses
Pantagruel on their first meeting, English has a place, but
is hardly recognisable in its Scottish dress.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> And the
Maréchal de Villars relates in his memoirs<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> that the Duc
de la Ferté, "quand il avait un peu bu," would break out
in English to the great astonishment and amusement of all
who were present. There is a tradition that Corneille kept
a copy of the English translation of the <i>Cid</i>, which he showed
to his friends as a curiosity.</p>

<p>Yet the general ignorance of English outside England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">-274-</a></span>did not discourage English actors from making professional
tours abroad. They seem to have enjoyed considerable
popularity in Germany and the Low Countries,<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> where
they played at first in English. No doubt dancing, mimicry,
and music had much to do with their success, and the clown
probably took advantage of his position to offer interpretations
from time to time. However, the actors soon learnt some
German by mixing with German actors. A band of English
acrobats had performed at Paris in 1583. Some years later,
in 1598, a troupe of English comedians hired the Hôtel de
Bourgogne,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> the only theatre in Paris, from the <i>Confrérie
de la Passion</i>, who usually played there. The English actors,
at whose head was one Jehan Sehais, got into trouble for
playing outside the Hôtel, contrary to the privileges of the
<i>Confrérie</i>, and had to pay an indemnity. How much these
actors made use of their language for attracting an audience
is not certain. At a somewhat later date, another company
played at Fontainebleau before Henry IV. and his son, afterwards
Louis XIII. The "wild dramas" acted by the English
players seem to have made a great impression on the young
prince, who afterwards would amuse himself by dressing as a
comedian and crying in a very loud voice, "Toph, toph, milord!"
pacing about with great strides in the fashion of the English
actors.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> But it is highly probable that these few words were
all the English the future king of France could muster.</p>

<p>Like the language, English literature was generally
ignored in France. Those men of letters who wrote Latin&mdash;More,
Camden, Selden, etc.&mdash;were known under their Latin
names. In the early years of the seventeenth century,
however,<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> the French began to take an interest in English
literature, and a few translations of prose works appeared,
though English poetry and drama remained unnoticed. The
first French version of an English work was that of Bishop
Hall's <i>Characters of Vertues and Vices</i> which appeared in 1610,
and again in 1612 and 1619, and may have had some influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">-275-</a></span>on
<span class="sidenote">NEGLECT OF ENGLISH</span>La Bruyère's <i>Caractères</i>. It is also interesting to note that
this enterprising translator was no other than J. L'Oiseau
de Tourval, Parisien, who wrote so enthusiastically of
Cotgrave's dictionary, which appeared in the following year
(1611).<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> In the course of the next twenty years about a
score of other translations saw the light, including versions
of Greene's <i>Pandosta</i> (1615), of Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>, and of
Bacon's <i>Essays</i>. The translation of the <i>Arcadia</i> was the
subject of a violent literary quarrel. Two versions came
out at the same time, and both claimed priority. One was
due to J. Baudouin, who had lived two years in England
learning the language. He was also responsible for the
translation of Bacon.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> His rival was one Mlle. Chappelain.</p>

<p>"English is a language that will do you good in England,
but past Dover it is worth nothing," wrote John Florio the
language teacher, in his <i>First Frutes</i> (1578). And more
than half a century later English was still despised in foreign
countries. While French was of use "in all furthest parts
of Europe," English still served "but in the Brittaine lland,"<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>
and even there did not receive due homage. English, we are
told by an indignant upholder of the claims of our language,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
was left for him who drives the plough; all the scholars, all
the courtiers you passed in the street, were good scholars
in foreign tongues; many of them chatted French as glibly
as parrots, but could not write a single English line without
a solecism. But in the meantime the study of English had
had its advocates.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Richard Mulcaster has already been
mentioned as the first Englishman who emphatically urged
that English should be studied as thoroughly as foreign
languages. "What reason is it," he asked, "to be acquainted
abrode and a stranger at home? to know foreign things
by rule, and our own but by rote? If all other men had
been so affected, to make much of the foren and set light by
their own, we should never by comparing have discerned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">-276-</a></span>better. They proined their own speche, both to please themselves
and to set us on edge." This was in 1582. Scholars
took up the defence of the claims of English against French,
just as they did the claims of Latin. Camden seeks to prove
that English contains as many Greek words as French,<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> and
so is as worthy of respect. And Osborne, in his <i>Advice to a
Son</i>, tells the young diplomat to employ an interpreter in his
dealings with these foreigners who refused to recognize the
value of English, "it being too much an honouring of their
Tongue, and undervaluing of your owne, to propose yourself
a master therein, especially since they scorn to learn yours."
There were, however, a few facilities for learning English at
the disposal of foreigners, in addition to residence in England.
The marriage of Charles I. with Henrietta Maria had been
hailed both in France and England by books which taught
the languages of the two countries conjointly, and so
strengthened the new bond between them. In England
appeared a new edition of Du Bartas, in French and English,
for teaching "an Englishman French, or a Frenchman
English." Wodroeph's <i>Marrow of the French Tongue</i> (1625),
which saw the light at the same time, was said to be "aussi
utile pour le François d'apprendre l'Anglois que pour l'Anglois
d'apprendre le François," though only the dialogues in French
and English could serve this purpose, as, indeed, they might
in any other French text-book.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> This notice is evidently
added merely as a concession to topical events; it had not
figured in the earlier edition (1623).</p>

<p>In France, on the other hand, was published a work in which
English was treated more seriously. This was a <i>Grammaire
Angloise pour facilement et promptement apprendre la langue
angloise. Qui peut aussi aider aux Anglois pour apprendre
la langue Françoise: Alphabet Anglois contenant la pronunciation
des lettres avec les declinaisons et conjugaisons</i>, dedicated
to Henrietta Maria, and probably arranged by one of the
professors of the Collège de Navarre, from which it is dated.
We are informed that the princess, and those intending to
accompany her to her new home, studied English daily.
These lessons, if they were really given, were no doubt a
matter of form, and we may judge from the results that they
were not taken seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">-277-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">ENGLISH GRAMMARS</span>

This grammar issued in 1625 was not original; it had
appeared at Rouen in 1595,<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> and before that date there had
been several other editions. The 1595 edition was enlarged
and corrected by a certain E. A., who, for about ten years
previously, had spent much of his time translating French
pamphlets on topical events and similar works from French
into English.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> E. A., who was probably the original compiler
of the work, dedicated it to Queen Elizabeth. He says he had
collected the material from different authors in the leisure
time allowed him by his studies. In its contents the work
resembles the usual French manuals produced in England.
It opens with rules for the pronunciation of English, followed
by grammar rules for the same language, all given in
French and English. Then come the dialogues, taken textually
and without acknowledgement from Holyband's <i>French
Littleton</i>, and one dialogue specially for courtiers, which may
have been original.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> The book closes with the vocabulary of
Holyband's <i>French Schoolemaister</i>. The grammatical part of
the work is also taken from one of the productions of the French
teachers in England&mdash;the <i>Maistre d'escole anglais</i> (1580), written
by Jacques Bellot for teaching English to foreigners in England
and dedicated to a member of the royal family of France.</p>

<p>Bellot protests against the general neglect of the English
language, rich enough in his opinion to rank with the most
famous living tongues. He claims to be the first to draw up
precepts for teaching it. There is little exaggeration in Bellot's
claim, for hardly any works on English had as yet been
written, and these were chiefly treatises on the orthography,
more scholastic than pedagogic in intention.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> At the close
of the year in which Bellot's work was published, however,
appeared the first work on English by an Englishman, designed
to give instruction to foreigners as well as his own countrymen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">-278-</a></span>This was William Bullocker's <i>Booke at large for the Amendment
of Orthographie for English Speech</i>, to which was added "a ruled
grammar ... for the same speech to no small commoditie
of the English Nation, not only to come to easie, speedie and
perfect use of our owne language, but also to their easie and
speedie and readie entrance into the secrets of other Languages,
and easie and speedie pathway to all strangers, to use
our language, heretofore very hard unto them."</p>

<p>Two years later came Mulcaster's <i>Elementarie</i>, urging
the claims of the vernacular, and expounding his method
for teaching it. Other grammars followed, some in Latin,
some in English,<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> but in hardly any of them is any attention
paid to foreigners&mdash;a striking contrast with those published
in France, in which foreigners were always an important
consideration. In 1632, however, appeared Sherwood's
English-French Dictionary, of which, it is said, the French
were "great buyers." Towards the middle of the seventeenth
century foreigners received more and more attention in such
books, as English became better known. Simon Daines's
<i>Orthoepia anglicana</i>,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> for instance, intended for the use of
both natives and foreigners, was published in 1640, as was
also <i>The English grammar made by Ben Jonson for the benefit
of all strangers out of his observation of the English language
now spoken and in use</i>.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> Ben Jonson had made a collection
of grammars, and he speaks of a most ancient work written
in the Saxon tongue and character. "The profit of grammar
is great to strangers, who have to live in communication and
commerce with us," he wrote, "and it is honourable to ourselves."
In 1644 another work of like aim was issued under
one of the usual florid titles affected at that time: <i>The
English Primrose far surpassing others of this kind that ever
grew in any English garden.</i> It professed to teach "the true
spelling, reading and writing of English," and was "planted"
by Richard Hodges, schoolmaster in Southwark, "for the
exceeding great benefit both of his own countrymen and
strangers." Similarly J. Wharton's grammar of 1655 claimed
to be "the most certain guide that ever yet was extant" for
strangers that desire to learn our language.</p>

<span class="sidenote">ENGLISH GRAMMARS FOR FOREIGNERS</span>

Thus travellers to England would find some provision for
learning English. In the early seventeenth century several
French teachers in London undertook to teach English to
foreigners, and these were the earliest professional teachers
of the language. They had all learnt English after their
arrival in the country on very practical methods, an experience
which must have reacted on their methods of teaching French.
Most of them wrote English with ease, if not always idiomatically.
As time advanced, especially in the latter part of the
seventeenth century, they composed several English grammars
for teaching the language to their pupils. Merchants
as well as French teachers were pioneers in advancing the
study of English by foreigners. In 1622 George Mason, one
of the merchants in London skilled in the French tongue,
wrote a <i>Grammaire Angloise, contenant reigles bien exactes et
certaines de la Prononciation, Orthographie et construction de
nostre langue, en faveur des estrangers qui en sont desireux</i>, but
especially, he tells us, for the use of "noz françois tant a leur
arrivée en ce pais, que en leur demeure en iceluy." This
English grammar<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> is written in French, and gives rules for
pronunciation and the parts of speech. It is followed by
dialogues<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> in French and English, in the usual style, bearing
much resemblance to the Latin colloquies and the dialogues
of De la Mothe's <i>French Alphabet</i>. A new edition was issued at
London in 1633. The earliest conversation books in French
and English printed by Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, and Pynson
are called books for teaching English as well as French. They
were indeed equally adapted for either language, but it is very
improbable that at this early date even the most enterprising
merchants learnt English.</p>

<p>Yet the first foreigners to recognize the importance of English
were merchants. English was given a place by the side of
Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and German in the edition of
the polyglot dictionary for the use of merchants and travellers,
printed at Venice in 1540,<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> and at a later date in the polyglot
collection of dialogues which developed from the French and
Flemish dialogues of Noel de Barlement; not, however, till
1576, when the book had been in vogue for about three-quarters
of a century. Gabriel Meurier, schoolmaster of
Antwerp, who taught French to many of the numerous English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">-280-</a></span>merchants always in the town, was acquainted with our
language, but does not appear to have had any opening for
teaching it, as he did French, Flemish, Italian, and Spanish.
At a later date, however, we find an Englishman gaining his
livelihood by teaching his own language in the Netherlands.
In 1646 he published at Amsterdam <i>The English schole-master;
or certaine rules and helpes, whereby the natives of the
Netherlands may be in a short time, taught to read, understand
and speake the English tongue, by the helpe whereof the English
may be better instructed in the knowledge of the Dutch tongue,
than by any vocabulars, or other Dutch and English Books,
which hitherto they may have had for that purpose</i>. This work
contains an English grammar, followed by selections from the
Scriptures, moral and familiar sayings, proverbs, dialogues,
letters in English and Dutch. The "Vocabulars" to which
he refers furnished him with most of his dialogues. A new
edition appeared in 1658.</p>

<p>Rouen, ever a busy centre for merchants, was the place
where provision for teaching English was first made in France.
Editions of the polyglot dictionary, which included English
in the edition of Venice in 1540, were printed at Rouen in 1611
and 1625, and again at Paris in 1631. The 1595 edition of
E. A.'s English grammar appeared at Rouen, as had probably
the earlier editions. This compilation of the English grammar
of Bellot and the dialogues of Holyband was in vogue for a very
long time. In addition to the Paris issue on the occasion of the
marriage of Henrietta Maria with Charles I. (1625), editions
appeared at Rouen in 1639, 1668, 1670, 1679, and most
probably at other dates also; another was issued at London,
1677. Perhaps the first book for teaching English printed in
France was a <i>Traicté pour apprendre a parler Françoys et
Anglois</i>, published at Rouen in 1553, apparently an early
edition of Meurier's work, printed at Rouen in 1563 as a
<i>Traité pour apprendre a parler françois et anglois, ensemble
faire missives, obligations,</i> etc., and again at Rouen in 1641.</p>

<p>It was long before English won recognition from foreigners
other than merchants. Not until the eighteenth century
was it learnt for the sake of its literature, and as a means of
intercourse with the people who spoke it. This state of
things made it incumbent on Englishmen to equip themselves
with some foreign tongue, and they naturally chose
French, the most universal language at that time.</p>

to England, except those engaged on diplomatic missions, or exiles. Thus, Ronsard,
Jacques Grévin, Brantôme, Bodin, in the sixteenth century; Schelandre, d'Assoucy,
Boisrobert, Le Pays, Pavillon, Voiture, Malleville, and a few others in the early
seventeenth century, spent a short time in England. Among scholars, Peiresc,
Henri Estienne, Justel, Bochart, and Casaubon visited our country. St. Amant
was twice in England, and on the occasion of his second visit wrote a satirical
poem, <i>Albion</i>, in which he gave vent to his dislike of the people and the country
(<i>&#338;uvres</i>, ed. Livet, 1855, vol. ii.). Guide-books to England were few, and far
from giving a good impression of the country. See Jusserand, <i>Shakespeare in France</i>,
pp. 8, 129.</p></div>

<h3>FRENCH GRAMMARS&mdash;BOOKS FOR TEACHING LATIN AND
FRENCH&mdash;FRENCH IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most noted teachers of English as well as of
French was Robert Sherwood, who in 1632 completed his
English-French Dictionary which was appended to the new
edition of Cotgrave's work issued in that year.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> Sherwood
was born in Norfolk,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> although he later called himself a
Londoner. In July 1622 he entered Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1626. He then moved
to London and opened a language school in St. Sepulchre's
Churchyard, where he continued to teach for many years.
He also taught English to many French, German, Danish,
and Flemish nobles and gentlemen who visited London. To
these distinguished visitors he dedicated his dictionary in 1632,
as well as the second edition of his French grammar in 1634,
expressing the hope that he would soon be able to produce
an English grammar "toute entière," for only the practical
exercises in French and English could be of use to them in their
study of English. His French grammar was intended "for the
furtherance and practice of gentlemen, scollers and others
desirous of the said language." We gather that Sherwood's
school was limited entirely to the higher classes, and was very
different from Holyband's noisy and bustling establishment.</p>

<p>The first edition of Sherwood's <i>French Tutour</i>, as he called
his grammar, saw the light in 1625,<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> just before he graduated
at Cambridge. He had probably worked at it as well as at
his dictionary during his residence there, and appears to
have taught French to private pupils. How he first acquired
his knowledge of French, we do not know. He may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">-282-</a></span>spent some years in France before going to Cambridge, since
he would not find much opportunity of studying the language
there. His work is little more than a translation of selections
from the French grammar of Charles Maupas of Blois (1625).
Perhaps he studied the language with Maupas himself, of
whom he speaks with great respect. In parts of his grammar,
however, Sherwood drew on his own "long experience" in
teaching French.</p>

<p>The second edition of the <i>French Tutour</i> (1634) is said to be
carefully corrected and enlarged. In it Sherwood follows the
usual order of treatment. First come rules of pronunciation,
then of grammar, which show "the nature and use of the
Articles, a thing of no small importance in this language:
also the way to find out the gender of all nounes: the conjugation
of all the verbs regular and irregular; and after which
followeth a list of most of the indeclinable parts (which
commonly do much hinder learners) Alphabetically Englished;
with a most ample syntax of all the parts of speech." This
section closes with an alphabetical index "interpreting such
nounes and verbes as are unenglished in the grammar." The
practical exercises are in the form of "three dialogues and
a touch of French compliments," in French and English,
arranged in two parallel columns on a page. The first deals
with familiar talk by the wayside, depicting travellers on
their road to London, and, on their arrival, taking lodgings
at the Black Swan in Holborn, doing their shopping, and
taking their evening meal. The other two dialogues treat
of less familiar subjects; and, on the whole, Sherwood's book
was not of a popular kind, but was intended for the "learned."
One describes the exercises and studies of the nobility, dancing,
riding, fencing, hunting, geography, cosmography, and so forth;
and the other turns on the subject of travel in foreign countries,
in which Sherwood emphasizes the necessity for the traveller
of "some good and fundamental beginning in the language
of the country whither he goeth." The <i>Tutour</i> closes with
a selection of French compliments from the book of M. L.
Miche on French courtesy, to which Sherwood added an
English version.</p>

<p>Another Englishman also ventured in the early years of
the seventeenth century to write on the French language&mdash;William
Colson, who called himself a Professor of Literal
and Liberal Sciences. He had spent many years abroad as
<span class="sidenote">WILLIAM COLSON</span>travelling companion to young English gentlemen, "as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">-283-</a></span>
well learning as teaching such laudable arts and qualities
as are most fitting for a gentleman's exercise." Seemingly
he spent some time in the Low Countries, and he may
have found his pupils among the English troops serving
there, as in 1603 he published at Liége a book in French on
arithmetic which also provides military information. Before
1612 he had returned to London, where he composed a similar
work in English, dedicated to the Lords of the Privy Council.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>
He tells us that on his return from his travels he wrote "certaine
litteral workes," mostly on the teaching of languages, and like
an earlier English writer, John Eliote, evolved a special
method which he called "arte locall or the arte of memorie."
He expounds his "method," which is very vague and obscure
in its application, in one of his French text-books which
appeared in London in 1620 and was called <i>The First Part of
the French grammar, Artificially Deduced, into Tables by Arte
Locall, called the Arte of Memorie</i>. Colson desired to reconcile
the old orthography with the new, as Holyband had done
earlier, by means of a reformed alphabet of twenty-six letters,
and of a triple distinction of characters, Roman, Italian, and
English. Roman type was to stand for the <i>proper</i> pronunciation,
that is, letters which are pronounced as they are written;
the Italian for the <i>improper</i>, that is, letters which are not
given their usual pronunciation; and finally the letters
written but not sounded were to be printed in black letter.
In his reformed alphabet he divides the letters into seven
vowels and eighteen consonants, and subdivides the consonants
into semivowels and mutes. He gives each letter its
usual name, and then its special name according to his own
scheme, as follows:</p>

<p class="noi">And all the said Alphabet is briefly contained in these five artificiall
words to be learnt by heart:&mdash;Haeiou&mdash;sezexeie&mdash;lereneme&mdash;fe&#923;ebepe&mdash;detegeke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">-284-</a></span>After treating of the letters, Colson proceeds to deal with
the other three chief parts of grammar&mdash;"the sillible, the
diction, and the locution" (the last two dealing with accidence
and syntax respectively) in a similarly intricate and obscure
style. It is difficult to imagine what can have been his
reasons for his scheme of complicated divisions and sub-divisions,
more like a puzzle than anything else. Yet he
appears to have been serious, and assures us that once his
reformed alphabet is mastered "the perfect pronunciation,
reading, and writing of the French tongue is gotten in the
space of one month or thereabouts." It is not surprising
that his attempted reform passed quite unheeded.</p>

<p>This <i>First Part of the French grammar</i>, which is dedicated
to "the Worshippfull, worthie and vertuous gentleman,
M. Emanuel Giffard, Esquire," seems to be the only one of
Colson's works on the French language which has survived.
At its close is a large folding sheet, containing the table of his
reformed alphabet, dedicated to Sir Michael Stanhope and
Sir William Cornwallis by their affectionate servant. The
date is 1613. Colson informs us that he had also compiled a
French grammar divided into four parts, after a new method.
He likewise refers to "all his bookes tending to the instruction
of the French tongue," such as his "booke of the declination of
nouns, and conjugation of Verbes," and his "three repertories
of the English, French, and Latine tongues, compounded by
arte locall for aiding the memorie in learning most speedily
the words of the foresaide tongues by heart in halfe time":
his "Repertoire of all syllables in general and of all French
words in particular containing the Art to learn them easily
by heart in verie short time and with little labour to the great
contentment of him which is desirous of the French tongue,
all reduced into Tables by Art Locall as before said": and
"other works of ours shortly to be printed tending to the
knowledge of the foresaid tongues, in which works is set downe
by Art and order local (called the Art of Memory) most easy
and brief rules to learne the foresaid bookes by heart." Most
of these, no doubt, were short pamphlets, perhaps in the shape
of the large folding sheet inserted at the end of the Grammar
of 1620, and so stood but little chance of survival.</p>

<p>At this same period the popular French grammar of Charles
Maupas, well known to many travellers to France, was translated
into English by William Aufeild and published in 1634.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">-285-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">WILLIAM AUFEILD</span>Maupas's grammar, first printed at Blois in 1607, had won a
considerable reputation in England, and was not without
noticeable influence on the French grammars published in
London. Sherwood, who had made free use of Maupas,
praised him very highly. James Howell, in his edition of
Cotgrave's Dictionary, advises students to seek fuller grammatical
information in Maupas's Grammar, "the exactest
and most scholarlike of all." William Aufeild, the translator
of the book&mdash;"the best instructions for that language
by the consent of all that know the book, that were ever
written"&mdash;considers that it excels all the French grammars
ever produced in England: "all of them put together do
not teach half so well the idiom of the French tongue as
this one doth." We are assured that the work was in
great demand when it first appeared in England, and that a
great number of the nobility and gentry were commonly
taught by means of it. Finding that the fact that it was
written in French was a great drawback, as it could only be
used by those who already understood French, Aufeild decided
to translate it into English, and dedicated his work to the
young Duke of Buckingham,<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> son of the duke to whom
Maupas had offered the original. Aufeild tells that he had
been studying French for ten years when he undertook his
task. He called the translation <i>A French grammar and
Syntaxe, contayning most exact and certaine Rules for the
pronunciation, Orthography, construction and use of the French
language</i>.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>To adapt the work to the use of the English, the translator
placed a small cross under letters not pronounced in the
French word, thus adopting Holyband's plan. These letters
were also printed in a different type, "that better notice
might be taken of them." He also endeavours to give the
sounds of the French alphabet in English spelling, so that if
the student "pronounce the one like an Englishman, he must
needs pronounce the same sounds, written after the French
manner, like a Frenchman." This, he says, is the only invention
which he claims as his own in the whole work. "The
examples as well as the text, are englished to save the reader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">-286-</a></span>so many lookings in his Dictionary"; and the word to which
the rule has special reference is printed in different type from
the rest of the example. Occasionally the text is expanded
by additional explanations, included in parentheses.</p>

<p>Aufeild advises the student of French to read the whole
grammar through first, in order to get a general notion of
the language. It is vain, he argues, to begin learning rules
for the pronunciation of a language of which you are totally
ignorant. Especially is this so in the case of the "unlearned,"
that is, those unacquainted with Latin grammar. For
instance, "you shall find that in all the third persons plural
of verbes ending in <i>-ent</i>, <i>n</i> is not pronounced," and so on.
Now, "unless a man can distinguish an adverbe from a verbe,"
he says, "or till he know how the plurall number is made of
the singular how shall he know ... when to leave out <i>n</i> before
<i>t</i>?" "In my opinion," he adds, "it is but a dull and wearisome
thing for a man to take a great deale of paines, in learning
to pronounce what he understandeth not." Clearly his ideal was
a preliminary grounding in the general principles of grammar.
When you have a general knowledge of the whole language
you may begin at the pronunciation and "so goe through it
againe in order as it lieth." In the second reading the student
should take into account the less important rules which are
omitted in the first perusal.</p>

<p>Aufeild's final piece of advice is at variance with the general
practice among teachers of the time. He would have the
pupil postpone all attempts at speaking the language until
the last stages: "be not too greedy," he warns the reader,
"to be thought a speaker of French before you are sure you
understand what you read." The best known teacher of
Italian in the seventeenth century, Torriano, was of the same
opinion: "for the avoiding of a vulgar error or fault very
predominant in many, namely of being over hasty to be
speaking of a language, before it be well understood, I thought
not amiss to produce the quotation of one Mr. Wm. Aufeild....
I jump with him that they who are last at speaking speak
the best and surest and so much I find by my experience
among my scholars."<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> Many years before, Roger Ascham
had expressed the same view with regard to the teaching
of Latin. He admitted that the "dailie use of speaking was
the best method," but only provided the learner could always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">-287-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">AUFEILD'S ADVICE TO STUDENTS</span>hear the language spoken correctly and avoid "the habit of the
evil choice of words, and crooked forming of sentences"; but
as it is, <i>loquendo male loqui discunt</i>, and he advises the postponement
of speaking until some progress had been made.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p>Considering Aufeild's ideas as to the speaking of French,
we quite expect to find him condemning attempts to pick up
the language without the help of rules; "for if with Rules,
you shall be often at a loss, certainly you shall stick at every
word without them." It may be that "they which take
another way, may speake more words in halfe a yeare then
you shall in twelve month; but in a year's space you may,
with diligence and industry, speake better (and after a while
more) than another shall doe all his life time, unless there be
a vast disparity between your abilities of mind."</p>

<p>His attitude as to the respective importance of grammatical
study and its practical application was not in keeping
with that of Maupas, of whom he said, "I know not whom
you can equal to him." Maupas had written his grammar in
French instead of the international language, Latin, because
he advocated the study of the grammar in the French language
itself; he taught reading and pronunciation by means of reading
the grammar in French. Aufeild, on the contrary, considered
it a drawback that when English students travelled
into France they had to learn enough French to converse
with their teachers before they could learn of their teachers
how to converse with others. This was the reason which
induced him to translate the grammar, although in doing so
he, no doubt unconsciously, set at nought Maupas's principal
reason for writing it in French.</p>

<p>We know of no other French grammar produced in France
which was specially favoured by English learners of French.
But no doubt many Englishmen, besides those who travelled,
studied from French grammars. English travellers returning
from France would, no doubt, bring back grammars which
might also arrive through other channels. Even in the time
of Elizabeth foreign books had been freely imported into
England, and the foreign trade of the stationers of London
was very extensive. That the early French grammars were
known in England is shown by their influence on those produced
in England, although in many cases this is more readily
explained by the circumstance that they were the work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">-288-</a></span>Frenchmen newly arrived from France. However, it is not
likely that these French grammars were ever widely used in
England for learning the language, when books in English
were ready to hand and easier to use. In Scotland, on the
other hand, where such books were not in existence, they
were probably more widely employed. Both countries,
Scotland in particular, made free use of foreign text-books
for the teaching of Latin; but the case is hardly the same
for the international language.</p>

<p>In the meantime the production of French grammars in
England continued uninterruptedly. <i>The Flower de Luce
planted in England</i> was the title of a grammar which appeared
in 1619. This work was due to one Laur Du Terme, of whom
nothing is known beyond the fact that he was a Frenchman
and a protégé of Bacon, then Lord Chancellor. Du Terme
had evidently been in England long enough to acquire some
knowledge of English, in which he wrote his grammar. After
imploring his patron to water his 'flower' with a few drops
of favourable approbation, he proceeds to address the gentle
reader in these words: "Looke not in this Treatise, for any
eloquent words, nor polished sentences, for I doe not go about
to begge any favour nor insinuate into any man's love by
coloured and misticall phrases.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> Neither do I intend to teach
my masters, but in requitall of your kind curtesie in teaching
mee this little English I have, do in the same set downe suche
precepts as I find best for the pronouncing, understanding, and
speaking of the French tongue." These precepts he selected
from other grammars "used by many both teachers and
learners, yet I presume this will be as agreeable as any were yet,
and in brief containing more than ever I saw yet in English."
The pronunciation is explained by comparison with English
sounds, and then each part of speech is treated in turn;
constant analogies with Latin occur, and he also gives a list
of French suffixes with their Latin roots, and endeavours to
introduce the Latin gerund and supine into French grammar,
not being of those who sought to delatinize French grammar.
For the verbs he refers the student to the rules given by
Cotgrave at the end of his dictionary, "very profitable for
every learner to reade," where they are arranged in four
conjugations, "while some authors make three, some five,
some six, and little enough for the understanding of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">-289-</a></span>verbs."
<span class="sidenote">LAUR DU TERME</span>He makes no claim to completeness&mdash;"and if by
chance I have applied a rule instead of an exception or an
exception instead of a rule, the teacher may easily mend it,
and your courteous censure in reciprocall of the good-will
I beare unto you I hope will excuse it. Reade it over, but not
slightly, consider every rule and way every word in it."</p>

<p>Du Terme's aim in his rules is to be brief and plain. He
desired them to be regarded in the light of a reference book.
The student was to begin to read from the very first. The
<i>Flower de Luce</i> does not provide the usual stock of reading-exercises,
and Du Terme advises the student to use "any good
French author he likes best; and what word soever he goes
about to reade, let him looke upon his Rules concerning the
pronunciation of the letters, how they are pronounced in
several places, first the vowell, then what consonants are
before and after, and, having compared and brought all the
Rules concerning those letters together, he shall easily finde
the true pronunciation of any word." The sounds of the
language should be thoroughly mastered at the outset:
"Bestow rather five days in learning five vowels, then to
learne and passe them over in a day, as being the chief and
only ground of all the rest, without the which you shall loose
your labour, not being able to pronounce one diphthongue
unless you pronounce the vowels well, perfectly, neatly and
distinctly, without confounding one with another. The which
case you must observe in the consonants." For the proper
understanding of the matter read, he recommends the use of
"some bookes that are both English and French, as the Bible,
the Testament, and many others that are very common in
England." He admits that this method is slow and difficult
at first, "yet notwithstanding, after a little labour, will prove
exceeding easie, as by experience hath been tryed: in so much
as some have learned perfectly to reade and understande the
most part in less than the quarter of a year, onely applying
themselves unto it one hour and a half in a day."</p>

<p>Paul Cougneau or Cogneau, another French teacher of
London, also wrote a French grammar at this period. He
called it <i>A sure Guide to the French tongue</i>, and published it
in 1635. Cogneau had no mean opinion of his book. "It
hath in some things a peculiar way, not commonly traced
by others," he tells us. "In the beginning are rules of pronunciation,
then for the declension of articles, nouns and
pronouns, and in the end the conjugation of diverse verbs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">-290-</a></span>both personal and impersonal ... and throughout the
whole book there is so great a multiplicity of various phrases
congested as no one book for the bulk contains more. All
which besides are set forth with plainness as fit it for the
capacity even of the meanest. Much pains hath been employed
about it, and I hope not without great benefit and
profit in the right use of it, and consequently not unworthy
of the kind acceptance which I heartily wish." But the
work has little value or originality, in spite of its interest to
the modern reader. The rules occupy thirty pages only.
They are taken mainly from Holyband and De la Mothe.
The nouns, articles, and pronouns receive very meagre treatment,
but the auxiliaries and verbs, the regular and a few
irregular verbs, are fully conjugated at the end of the book,
being arranged in sentence form, as in many modern text-books:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="fr"><span class="i0">J'ay bien dormi ceste nuit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tu as trop mangé.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il a trop bu, etc.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">The practical exercises, which fill the next three hundred
pages, reproduce the dialogues of the same sixteenth-century
writers&mdash;the only two who retained their popularity in the
seventeenth. The exercises of the <i>French Schoolemaister</i>, the
<i>French Littleton</i>, and the <i>French Alphabet</i> are all repeated
without any acknowledgement.</p>

<p>Like Du Terme, Cogneau attached much importance to
pronunciation and reading. He held that pronunciation
was best learnt with the help of a teacher, and that rules were
not of much use in this case.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have observed," he writes, "how many of my countrymen have
taken great pains and labour to show the English how to pronounce the
French letters, by letters; but these men labour in vain: for I know that
the true pronunciation of any tongue whatsoever cannot be taught so: nor
none can learn it so; I mean, to speak it well and truly as it ought to be:
to learn to understand it by such rules, one may in time and with great
pains, but, as I have said, never to speak it well and perfectly, without
he be taught by some master. I say not that the rules are unprofitable,
no, for they are very profitable being well used, and the learner being well
directed to understand them aright; but, as I have said, so I say still,
that whosoever will learn this noble and famous tongue, must chuse one
that can speak good French, and one that hath a good method in teaching,
and the first thing to learn of him must be to pronounce perfectly our 22
letters, and give every one its due sound and pronunciation."</p></div>

<p class="noi">The student should undertake nothing until he has mastered
the sounds of the letters and syllables. <span class="sidenote">PAUL COGNEAU</span>Then he may pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">-291-</a></span>
to the reading, "and in that reading learn to spell perfectly,
for it is that which will perfect thee, so that thou wilt be able
to correct many Frenchmen both in their speaking and writing,
if thou wilt take pains to learn it perfectly and be as perfect
in it as in thy native tongue. If thou dost mark well what
I have said, and do it, and if thou hast a good teacher, thou
maiest learn the French tongue easily in a year." Cogneau
gives his grammar rules in both French and English, and
evidently intended them to form part of the reading material
on which the student was to begin as soon as he had mastered
the French sounds. From these he proceeds to the dialogues.
"Thou must learn this book perfectly, to read the French in
English and also the English in French perfectly, and I durst
warrant that whosoever shall learn this book perfectly will
be a perfect Frenchman, and shall be able both to speak and
write the French tongue much better than the most part
of Frenchmen." The only differences, then, between the
methods advocated by Laur Du Terme and Cogneau are
that the first would have the student learn the pronunciation
by reading, and the second from the lips of a master before
the student begins to read; and that Cogneau adopts the
method of double translation, so strongly urged by De la
Mothe, while Du Terme mentions only translation of French
into English. In fact, Cogneau's method was probably suggested
by the sixteenth-century teachers.</p>

<p>Cogneau's <i>Guide</i> was in vogue for a number of years. In
1658 a French teacher, Guillaume Herbert, who appears to
have had no mean opinion of his own abilities, edited the
fourth edition. He describes the earlier form of the work
as a "blind" guide rather than a sure one, but now that
it has been revised by him "both masters and scholars may
with more confidence venture upon it as the most correct
book now extant of this kind and in these tongues, and I
dare promise them that if I live to see and oversee the next
edition, I will so purge and order it that every reader may
(if ingenious and ingenuous) give it deservedly the name of
a Sure Guide." It is difficult to see in what the improvements
he boasts of consist, for his is little more than a reprint
of the earlier editions. With Herbert's edition the popularity
of the <i>Sure Guide</i> came to an end, no doubt owing to the
appearance of more recent works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">-292-</a></span>William Aufeild complained, not without reason, that most
professors teach only what other men "have set downe to
their hand in English many years agoe," and it is undeniable
that several of the sixteenth-century French grammars
continued to be used in England as late as the middle of the
seventeenth century. Holyband was specially in favour, and
so was De la Mothe. Peter Erondell, it has been seen, prepared
new editions of the <i>French Schoolemaister</i> in 1606, 1612, 1615,
and 1619. Another French professor, James Giffard, was
responsible for other editions in 1631, 1636, 1641, 1649, 1655,
and it appears to have been printed again in 1668; this
Giffard was probably the Jacques Giffard who attended the
Threadneedle Street Church;<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> he is said to have been a native
of the isle of Sark, and in 1640 he married Elizabeth Guilbert
of Guernsey. Editions of the <i>French Littleton</i> saw the light in
1602, 1607, 1625, 1630, 1633, and 1639. None of these editions
contains any very noticeable alterations. The new editions
of De la Mothe's <i>French Alphabet</i> (1625, 1631, 1633, 1639, and
1647) are merely reprints of the first edition of 1592. Thus it
came about that the French of the sixteenth century was still
taught in England in the seventeenth, regardless of the great
changes which had been accomplished in the language in the
meantime.</p>

<p>The first half of the seventeenth century was also a period
during which French began to receive greater recognition in the
educational world. Latin, it is true, retained its supremacy
in the grammar school; but it is significant that a considerable
number of Latin school-books were adapted to teaching
French, and helped to swell the number of such manuals at the
service of students. Thus French gained a place by the side
of Latin, and some went so far as to question the supremacy
of Latin as the "learned" tongue of Europe. In 1619
Thomas Morrice<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> deemed it necessary to refute the "error"
of those of his countrymen who placed French before Latin&mdash;"a
most absurd paradox" in his opinion, for "French was
never reckoned a learned tongue; it belongs by right to one
country alone, where the people themselves learn Latin."
Such protests had little effect. In the first years of the century
we have the earliest recognition of French as distinct from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">-293-</a></span>other modern languages, at the hands of a writer on education; <span class="sidenote">FRENCH MAKES HEADWAY</span>J. Cleland held that a young gentleman's tutor should be
skilled in the French as well as the Latin tongue, because "it
is most used now universallie,"<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> and that the student, after
translating English into Latin, should proceed to turn his
Latin into French, "that he may profit in both the Tongues
together."<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>It was indeed by no means uncommon for French and
English tutors to give instruction in both these tongues.
Denisot, Palsgrave, Holyband, and many other French
teachers had done so. Joseph Rutter, tutor to the son of
the Earl of Dorset, at whose request he translated the <i>Cid</i>
into English, is said to have made his pupil his collaborator
in this task, and probably taught him French as well as Latin,
and his case does not appear to have been exceptional. Evelyn,
the diarist, learnt the rudiments of Latin from a Frenchman
named Citolin, and probably picked up some French at the
same time; travel abroad and his marriage with the daughter
of Sir Richard Browne, English ambassador at Paris, who
from her youth upwards had lived in France, gave him opportunities
for improving his knowledge of the language, in which
he was soon able to converse with ease.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Evelyn's son Richard
also studied the two languages together; when he died in
1658, at the early age of five, he was able to say the catechism
and pronounce English, Latin, and French accurately, also "to
read an script, to decline nouns and conjugate all regular and
most of the irregular verbs." He had likewise "learn'd
<i>Pueriles</i>, got by heart almost the entire vocabulary of Latine
and French primitives and words, and could make congruous
syntax, turne English into Latine and <i>vice versa</i>, construe and
prove what he read, and did the government and use of relatives,
verbs, substantives, elipses, and many figures and tropes, and
made a considerable progress in Comenius's <i>Janua</i>, began himself
to write legibly, and had a strong passion for Greek."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>The manuals for teaching Latin and French together, either
Latin school-books with French added, or works specially
written for giving instruction in the two languages, probably
resulted from this connexion. At an early date French had
found a place in several Latin dictionaries.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Soon afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">-294-</a></span>it made its way into some of the Latin Colloquia and school
authors. In 1591 the printer John Wyndet received a
licence to print the dialogues of Corderius in French and
English.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> There is also a notice of an edition of Castellion's
<i>Sacred Dialogues</i> in the same two languages.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Aesop's <i>Fables</i>
were printed in English, French, and Latin in 1665, with the
purpose of rendering the acquisition of these languages easier
for young gentlemen and ladies; each fable is accompanied
by an illustration due to Francis Barlow, and followed
by a moral reflection. Thomas Philpott was responsible for
the English version, and Robert Codrington, M.A., a versatile
translator of the time, for the Latin and French. At least
two other editions appeared in 1687 and 1703. Another
favourite author was published in the same three languages
at a later date&mdash;the <i>Thoughts of Cicero ... on (1) Religion,
and (2) Man.... Published in Latin and French by the
Abbé Olivet, to which is now added an English translation, with
notes</i> (<i>by A. Wishart</i>) (1750 and 1773). Of these few examples
of Latin and French text-books, two are known only by hearsay.
It is likely that others, adapted to the same purpose, have disappeared
without leaving any trace at all; as such school-books
were usually printed with a privilege, their names are
not preserved in the registers of the Company of Stationers.
Little wonder that such manuals, subjected to the double wear
and tear of teaching both Latin and French, have been entirely
lost. The one volume which has come down to us is Aesop's
<i>Fables</i> in French, Latin, and English, and its survival is explained
by the elaborate and costly form in which it was issued.</p>

<p>In 1617 was published the <i>Janua Linguarum Quadralinguis</i>
of Jean Barbier, a Parisian. The work, originally written
in Spanish and Latin (1611) for the use of Spaniards, was in
time adapted to teaching Latin and incidentally Spanish to
the English, by the addition of an English translation in
1615. The fact that French was added two years later by
Barbier is not without significance. Foremost among books
for teaching French and Latin together, however, was the
famous <i>Janua Linguarum</i> of Comenius, from which Evelyn's
son learnt his Latin, and presumably his French also. It was
printed in England in English, French, and Latin, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">-295-</a></span>very
<span class="sidenote">BOOKS FOR TEACHING LATIN AND FRENCH</span>year in which it had first come out at Leszna in Latin
and German (1631). In this form it was given the title of
<i>Porta Linguarum trilinguis reserata et aperta, or the Gate of
Tongues unlocked and opened</i>. The <i>Janua</i> contains a thousand
sentences, dealing with subjects encyclopaedic in plan, beginning
with the origin of the world, and ending with death,
providence, and the angels. The intervening chapters treat
of the earth and its elements, animals, man, his life, education,
occupations, afflictions, social institutions, and moral qualities.
J. A. Anchoran, Licentiate in Divinity, a friend of Robert
Codrington and apparently a Frenchman, was responsible for
the edition of the <i>Porta Linguarum</i> in English, French, and
Latin. He declares he prepared it "in behalf of" the young
Prince Charles (II.), then about a year old, and of "British,
French and Irish youth." His efforts proved successful; there
were two issues of the work in 1631, and other editions
appeared in 1633, 1637, and 1639.</p>

<p>With the second and following editions was bound an index
to the French and Latin words contained in the <i>Porta
Linguarum</i>, entitled: <i>Clavis ad Portam or a Key fitted to open
the gates of tongues wherein you may readily find the Latine and
French for any English word, necessary for all young scholars.</i>
It was dedicated to the schoolmasters and ushers of England,
and printed at Oxford, being the work of Wye Saltonstall,
teacher of Latin and French in that University.</p>

<p>Yet another brief treatise was commonly bound with
the 1633 edition of the <i>Porta Linguarum</i>&mdash;<i>The Pathway
to the Gate of Tongues, being the first Instruction for little
children</i>, intended as an introduction to Comenius, but
chiefly to give instruction in French. It was due to one of
the French teachers in London, Jean de Grave, no doubt the
son of the "Jean de Grave natif d'Amsterdam" who came to
England in the early years of the seventeenth century and
died some time before 1612. De Grave was a member of the
French Church, and in 1615 was twice threatened with expulsion
owing to his sympathy with the Brownists; but he
saved the situation by recanting.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> De Grave's <i>Pathway</i> to
Comenius opens with a table of the numbers, the catechism,
graces, and prayers, all given in Latin, English, and French.
The main section gives the conjugation of the four regular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">-296-</a></span>verbs (<i>j'aime</i>, <i>je bastis</i>, <i>je voy</i>, <i>je li</i>) and of <i>aller</i>, <i>avoir</i>, <i>estre</i>,
<i>il faut</i> and <i>on aime</i>, in French accompanied by English and
Latin equivalents in parallel columns. De Grave makes a
point of omitting all the compound tenses usually introduced
into French verbs on the model of the Latin ones, as such
forms can only be expressed by means of paraphrases or of
the verbs <i>avoir</i> and <i>estre</i>; thus French rather than Latin
was in the author's mind: "Or m'a semblé qu'il ne fallait pas
charger au commencement la memoire des petits enfants
de choses desquelles le maistre diligent et industrieux, pourveu
qu'il soit homme lettré et bien entendu en la grammaire
françoise, pourra instiller peu à peu en leur esprit, plus par
diligente pratique que par cette facheuse et prolixe circonlocution
qui n'apporte aucun profit." He agreed with most
of the French teachers of the time that few rules and much
practice under the guidance of a good master, was the best
way of learning French.</p>

<p>In the first half of the seventeenth century also, the private
institutions in which French had a place increased considerably
in number, especially during the latter years of the reign
of Charles I. and the Commonwealth. There were several
projects, of which a few were actually realized for a time, for
founding academies in England on the model of those in France.
Their aim was to provide instruction in modern languages and
polite accomplishments, in order to counterbalance the one-sidedness
of the Universities, and save parents the expense of
sending their children abroad, and protect the latter from the
dangers to which they might be exposed in foreign countries.</p>

<p>In 1635 the accomplished courtier Sir Francis Kynaston
founded the <i>Museum Minervae</i> at his house in Bedford Square,
Covent Garden. Latin, French, and Italian were the chief
languages of the curriculum. No foreigner was allowed to act
as either regent or professor. A regulation stipulated that "noe
Gentleman shall speak in the forenoon to the Regent about
any businesse, but either in Italian, French, or Latin; but if
any gentleman be deficient in all these languages, then shall he
deale with some professour or other to speak unto the regent
for him in the morning, but in the afternoon free accesse shall
be granted to all that have any occasion to conferre with him."<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
A certain Michael Mason was the professor of languages. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">-297-</a></span>Academy
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH IN PRIVATE ACADEMIES</span>was short-lived, and probably did not survive its
founder, who died at the beginning of the Civil War.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July 1649, another Academy of similar nature
but wider scope was opened by the adventurous Sir Balthazar
Gerbier in his house at Bethnal Green. In 1648 he published a
prospectus, which appeared in several different forms, announcing
to "all fathers of noble families and lovers of vertue" that
"Sir Balthazar Gerbier, knight, erects an Academy wherein
forraigne Languages, Sciences and all noble exercises shall
be taught ... whereunto shall serve several treatises set
forth by the said Sir B. G. in the Forraigne languages aforesaid,
the English tongue being joyned thereunto ... whiche
Treatises shall be continually at Mistresse Allen's Shop at the
signe of the crown in Pope's head Alley neere the olde Exchange,
London." Gerbier's intention was to teach the sciences and
languages simultaneously, and by means of each other.
French seems to have been the only foreign language which
received special treatment at his hands. He was the author
of <i>An Introduction to the French Tongue</i>, a work of very slight
value, treating of the pronunciation and parts of speech and
followed by a lengthy and wearisome dialogue between three
travellers. Carrying out his expressed aim, he wrote several
pamphlets on the subjects of polite education in French
accompanied by a literal English translation.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> Every Saturday
afternoon a public lesson was read in the Academy, "as
well concerning the grounds and rules of the aforesaid languages,
as touching the sciences and exercises, which will
give much satisfaction to all Fathers of noble families and
lovers of vertue." There was also an "open lecture" by which
the deserving poor were to be instructed gratis, on due recommendation.
Gerbier is also said<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> to have started an Academy
for languages at Whitehall. None of his efforts, however, met
with much response. The private Academy as such was an
institution which never really took root in England. Moreover,
Gerbier was not a gifted man. The works he wrote for use
in his Academy have very little value, and his lectures were
severely criticised. Walpole calls one of them, typical of the
rest, "a most trifling superficial rhapsody."</p>

<p>Several other schemes<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> for courtly academies were never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">-298-</a></span>realised at all. Such were those of Prince Henry, son of
James I., and of Lord Admiral Buckingham. A play of
the Commonwealth period, Brome's <i>New Academy</i> (1658),
gives an amusing picture of one of these institutions and introduces
us to a group of pushing French men and women who
profess <i>inter alia</i> to "teach the French Tongue with great
alacrity."</p>

<p>Private schools, on the contrary, were better patronised.
There were undoubtedly numerous French schools in the style
of those of the sixteenth century; Wodroeph refers to one,
without giving any details, and the language school kept by
Sherwood was well known. In many instances also French
found a place in other private schools alongside the more
usual studies. Sir John Reresby, for example, was sent at
the age of fifteen to a school at Enfield Chase, where he was
instructed in Latin, French, writing, and dancing. There he
stayed two years and "came to a very passable proficiency in
Latin, Greek, French, and rhetoric."<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> The elder brother of
Thomas Ellwood, Milton's amanuensis, also learnt French and
Latin at a private school at Hadley, near Barnet in Hertfordshire,
before going with Thomas to learn Latin and some
Greek at the free school of Thame.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> Such schools seem to have
been relatively numerous at the time of the Commonwealth.
One was kept by Edward Wolley, D.D. of Oxford, who had been
domestic chaplain to Charles I., and taken refuge in France
on his sovereign's death. After spending seven years abroad
as chaplain to Charles II. in exile, he returned to England and
opened a school at Hammersmith. In 1654 the Protector
issued stringent orders against "scholemasters who are or
shall be Ignorant, Scandalous, Insufficient or Negligent."
Many royalists were affected, and it was no doubt as a result
of this measure that in 1655 Wolley had to petition Cromwell
to allow him to continue his "painful employment" of instructing
youth in Latin, Greek, French, and other commendable
exercises. He pleads that since his return from France
he has demeaned himself irreproachably, and that he causes
"the Holy Scriptures to be read and religious duties to be daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">-299-</a></span>used" in his school,
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS</span>and takes the children to church on Sunday;
moreover "they have always spoken with honour and reverence
of his Highness."<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> Among the few royalist and episcopal
schoolmasters who were not affected by the measure of 1654
was Samuel Turberville, a "very good schoolmaster," who
kept school in Kensington. Sir Ralph Verney's second son
Jack, afterwards apprenticed to a merchant, spent three
years there (1656-59), and Turberville commends his "amendement
in writing, the mastery of his grammar and an indifferent
Latin author, his preservation of the ffrench, and the command
of his Violl."<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> Sir Ralph Verney's son had previously
acquired French in France, and wrote it fluently though not
always correctly.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> His fellow-pupils, we are told, called him
the "young mounseer."</p>

<p>There were also numerous schools for young ladies and
gentlewomen in and about London and elsewhere. One
French teacher, Paul Festeau, advertises the French boarding-school
of Monsieur de la Mare at Marylebone, where girls were
taught "to write, to read, to speak French, to sing, to dance,
to play on the guitar and the spinette."<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> M. de la Mare was
a Protestant, and a reader at the French Church. His wife was
a good mother to the girls, we are told, and his daughter spoke
French with much elegance. Another French teacher, Pierre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">-300-</a></span>Berault, mentions the pension for young ladies kept by his
friend M. Papillon in Charles Street, near St. James's Square.
French, writing, singing, dancing, and designing were the subjects
of study. In other cases schools for girls and young
ladies were attended by a visiting French master. The most
popular French teacher of the time, Claude Mauger of Blois,
was employed for some time after his arrival in England as
French teacher to the young ladies of Mrs. Kilvert's once
famous Academy. This practice became more and more
widespread as the seventeenth century advanced, and was
very common in the eighteenth century, as it still is nowadays.</p>

<h3>THE "LITTLE BLOIS" IN LONDON</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> the second half of the seventeenth century we come across a
band of French teachers in London, which corresponds, in importance,
to that which grouped itself round Claude Holyband
in the vicinity of St. Paul's Churchyard at the same period
in the sixteenth century. At its head was Claude Mauger,
a native of Blois. Mauger had as long a teaching experience
in London as Holyband; he arrived in about 1650, and we
do not hear the last of him till the first decade of the next
century. He was forced to quit his native town by "intestine
distempers," probably an allusion to the persecutions which
broke out there in the middle of the century. He appears to
have been a Huguenot. Before coming to England he had been
a student at Orleans, and for seven years had taught French to
travellers, "the flowre of all Europe," at Blois,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> where some
years previously Maupas had laboured at the same task;
among his pupils was Gustavus Adolphus, Prince of Mecklenburg.
On arriving in England, Mauger exercised the same
profession. And several others, driven from Blois like
himself, gathered around him as friends, admirers, and fellow-workers.
Among these, he tells us, he reckons Master Penson
and Master Festeau as specially good masters of language. Of
Penson nothing is known, save that he wrote some lines
addressed to Mauger's critics. Festeau, however, is mentioned
elsewhere by Mauger with high commendation, and the two
seem to have been close friends. He came to England
about the same time as Mauger, and may have accompanied
him. These members of the "Little Blois" in London
prided themselves on teaching the accent of Blois, "where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">-302-</a></span>the true tone of the French tongue is found, by the unanimous
consent of all Frenchmen." The accent of Blois had already
been recommended by some of the earlier French teachers.
Charles Maupas was its foremost champion.</p>

<p>Fate had been very unkind to him before his arrival in
England, Mauger tells us. But he soon forgot his sorrows
in his busy and successful life in London. Pupils flocked
to him, and, as we saw, he was called upon by Mrs. Margaret
Kilvert to teach French in her Academy for young gentlewomen&mdash;a
place, according to him, "which needs nothing,
only a name worthy to expresse its excellency." At the
same time he was busy writing a French grammar, which
appeared in 1653, and was dedicated to Mrs. Kilvert&mdash;<i>The
True Advancement of the French Tongue, or a New Method
and more easie directions for the attaining of it than ever yet
have been published</i>, preceded by verses addressed to no less
than fifty of his lady pupils. It does not differ materially
as regards its contents from previous works of the kind and
had apparently been first written in French, for Mauger says
his work "hath now put on a language to which it was before
a stranger." Rules of grammar and pronunciation occupy
the first hundred and twenty pages, and the remaining half of
the book comprises reading exercises in French and English,
and a vocabulary. The sound of each letter is explained,
then the declinable parts are treated in turn, and
followed by a few scattered rules of syntax. The whole
is a little incoherent, and lacks order. Mauger was evidently
acquainted with the work of his fellow-townsman Charles
Maupas.</p>

<p>The second section of Mauger's grammar begins with
lists of anglicisms to be avoided,<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> and then of "certaine
francisms," or French idioms, and of familiar French phrases
for common use. The dialogues turn chiefly on the study of
French, and include discussions between students of French,
talk of travel in France, and polite and gallant conversations
between French and English ladies and gentlemen. Considering
Mauger's many women pupils, it is not surprising
to find a considerable part of his book devoted to them: two
ladies discuss French and their French teacher, criticise the
French accent of their friends, or receive visits or lessons from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">-303-</a></span>their French, music, or dancing masters.
<span class="sidenote">CLAUDE MAUGER</span>And as the two
latter, especially the dancing-master, were usually French,
they did much to assist the language tutor. French maids
are also often introduced, and represented as instructing their
mistresses in the French language as well as in French fashions.
It is no doubt Mrs. Kilvert's Academy that is referred to in
the following dialogue:</p>

<p>In another dialogue a French gentleman compliments an
English lady on her French:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Où avés vous appris à parler François, Mademoiselle?</p>

<p>Monsieur, je ne parle pas, je ne fais que bégayer.</p>

<p>Je vous proteste que d'abord j'ay creu que vous fussiés Françoise.</p>

<p>Il est impossible à une Angloise de posséder vostre langue.</p>

<p>Vous m'excuserés, il s'en trouve beaucoup.</p>

<p>J'eus l'honneur il y a quelque temps d'entretenir une Dame qui parle
aussi nettement qu'une Françoise.</p>

<p>Je voy que vous avez inclination pour le François.</p>

<p>Fort grande.</p>

<p>Vous avez l'accent fort pur et net.</p>

<p>De qui apprenés vous?</p>

<p>D'un François nouvellement arrivé qui est de Blois.</p>

<p>Il est vray que la pureté du langage se trouve là, non pas seulement
l'accent, mais la vraye phrase.</p>

<p>Tout le monde le dit.</p>

<p>Vostre langue est fort difficile.</p>

<p>Je voudrois parler aussi bien que vous.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">-304-</a></span>There is only one dialogue on a subject usually contained
in French manuals&mdash;phrases for buying and selling. The
vocabulary, which closes the book, is of a more usual kind. It
is arranged under headings, beginning with the Godhead and
ending with a list of things necessary in a house.</p>

<p>This book of Mauger's enjoyed a greater and longer-lived
popularity than any that had yet appeared. Edition followed
edition until the end of the first decade of the eighteenth
century, and it continued to be plagiarised for another fifty
years. Its success can hardly have been due to the scholastic
value of its rules, which are few and confused, but rather to
its practical nature and lively dialogues. Mauger constantly
revised his grammar; of the earliest editions, no two are
identical. In each case he wrote new dedications, new
addresses to the reader, new dialogues, and varied the form
of the grammar rules. The second edition is much more
typical than the first. Mauger had been ill in 1653, and had
not been able to correct the proofs himself. This task he
entrusted to a friend (perhaps Festeau), who "betrayed his
expectation, and corrected it not exactly." He was likewise
unable to add the English column to the dialogues, a task
which was undertaken by the corrector of the press. In the
case of the second edition, however, he attended "three times
a day at the Presse," that he might correct it according "to
the expectation of those who will honour it with their reading."
He called it <i>Mr. Mauger's French Grammar</i>, and this was the
title under which it continued to be published.</p>

<p>Mauger dedicated the second edition to Colonel Bullar,
mentioning the many favours heaped upon him by that
officer. He again addresses French verses to numerous
English ladies, his pupils. The grammar rules are much the
same; the chief change in this part is the addition of a Latin
translation to the English, "for to render it generally useful
to strangers" visiting London, "which is this day accounted
one of the most glorious cities of the world." That Mauger
provided for the teaching of French to foreign visitors to
England shows how important a place the study of the language
held in our country, and we know that he numbered
a few foreigners among his many students of the language.
In this second edition he attempted, as Holyband had done
before him, to adapt the orthography to the pronunciation,
but without success. "I had thought," he writes, "for your
greater advantage, to have fitted the
<span class="sidenote">MAUGER'S FRENCH GRAMMAR</span>writing to the pronunciation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">-305-</a></span>
but having found that I could not do so, without an
absolute totall subverting of the foundations of the language,
I had rather teach you to read and speak together than to
show you how to speak without being able to read, or to read
without knowing how to speak. They might say nevertheless
that it would prevent many difficultyes if we did write
as we speak." Mauger decided to follow the rules of the
French Academy, instead of his own <i>caprichio</i> which would
"teach you to speak French without being able to read any
other book than that I should present you with": for "our
language," he said, "which is so highly esteemed by all
strangers for its noble etymologies of Greeke and Latine, will
not suffer itself to be so dismembered by the ignorance of those
which profess it, not having one letter which doth not distinguish
one word from another, the singular number from the
plurall, the masculine gender from the foeminine, or which
makes not a syllable long or short."</p>

<p>The dialogues are new, but very similar to those of the first
edition, the chief change being the introduction of a long and
"exact account of the state of France, ecclesiastical, civil, and
military as it flourisheth at present under King Louis XIV.,"
which was brought up to date in each subsequent edition.</p>

<p>In following years the dialogues become more numerous;
they number eighty in the sixth edition (1670). Each new
issue promises additions, "of the last concern to the reader."
A new feature in the sixth and seventh editions is a versified
rendering of the grammar rules, entitled <i>Le Parterre de la
langue françoise</i>. The verses were written at the request of
the Duke of Mecklenburg, his former pupil, and arranged in
the form of a dialogue between Mauger and the Duke, who
first addresses his master:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="fr"><span class="i0">Le Langage françois est si plein de merveilles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que ses charmans appas, ravissans nos oreilles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nous jettent sur vos bords pour gouster ses douceurs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et pour en admirer les beautéz et les fleurs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mais, pour nous l'acquérir il faut tant d'artifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qu'en ses difficultés il estreint nos delices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Estouffe nos desseins, traverse le plaisir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui flatoit nostre espoir d'y pouvoir réussir.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Les articles <i>de la</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>du</i>, sont difficiles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si vous ne les monstrez par vos reigles utiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ils nous font bégayer presques à tous momens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et ternissent l'éclat de nos raisonnemens.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">-306-</a></span>And Mauger answers him with an invitation to take what he
will from the "parterre."</p>

<p>Additional matter was introduced in 1673 in the shape
of short rules for the pronunciation of English, which in the
following editions were developed into a short English grammar,
written in French dialogues. Later Mauger modified
the arrangement of his French grammar rules, giving them
in parallel columns of French and English, in the form of
question and answer. The section dealing with the parts of
speech is recast in the form of a conversation between a
French master and his lady pupil. As to the dialogues, which
are all "modish"&mdash;there is not a word in them but is
"elegant"&mdash;they were divided into two categories, one elementary
and the other advanced. In the twelfth edition, for
instance, we have forty-six dialogues, in the style of those of
the earlier editions, and then ten longer and more difficult
ones. Mauger made hardly any changes in the issues that
followed the twelfth, and in this shape it passed down to the
eighteenth century. In the course of its development it had
grown to nearly twice its original size.</p>

<p>Mauger's popularity as a teacher of French grew apace
with his grammar. The commendatory poems, one by John
Busby, which are prefixed to the first two editions, show that
even at that early date he was held in high esteem by many
influential Englishmen; and each new edition was offered to
some new patron.</p>

<p>Mauger also published a collection of letters in French and
English, which he considered "a great help to the learner of
the French tongue," for "those who understand it with the
help of the English, are capable of explaining afterwards
any French author, being written on several subjects." The
<i>Lettres Françoises et Angloises de Claude Mauger sur Toutes
sortes de sujets grands et mediocres</i> were dedicated to Sir
William Pulteney. They were first issued in 1671, and again
in 1676, with the addition of fifty letters. Many are addressed
to gentlemen of note who had been his students at Blois, and
continued to correspond with him for the purpose of practice
in French. "Puisque vous désirez que je continue à vous
écrire des Lettres Françoises," he wrote to the Count of Praghen
in 1668, "pour vous exercer en cette langue qui est tant usitée
dans toutes les cours de l'Europe, je reçois vos ordres avec
joye." Others are addressed to pupils in London, including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">-307-</a></span>some of his large clientèle of ladies.
<span class="sidenote">MAUGER'S FRENCH AND ENGLISH LETTERS</span>For instance, he writes
to a certain Mrs. Gregorie:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Ayant ouï dire que vous estes allée a la campagne pour quinze jours,
durant cette belle saison en laquele la nature déploye ce qu'elle a de plus
beau, j'ay pris la hardiesse de vous écrire cette lettre en François pour vous
exercer en cette langue que vous apprenez avec tant de diligence. Je suis
bien aise que vous vous y adonniez si bien, car, comme vous avez la mémoire
admirable, vous en viendriez bien tost à bout.</p></div></div>

<p class="noi">He seems to have made a regular practice of exercising his
pupils' French by writing to them in the language.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Among
his young English pupils was William Penn, the Quaker, to
whom he wrote a letter dated 1670:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Je n'entendrois pas bien mes interests si Dieu m'ayant fait si heureux
de vous monstrer le François que vous apprenez si bien, je n'en témoignois
de la joye, en faisant voir à tout le Monde, que l'honneur que vous me
faites de vous servir de moy, pour vous l'acquérir est tres grand. En effet
monsieur, n'est-ce pas un bon-heur? Car je perdrois mon credit si Dieu
ne me suscitoit de tems en tems des personnes comme vous, qui par leur
diligence et capacité avec l'aide de ma méthode le soutiennent. . . . J'ay
bien de la satisfaction qu'elle [<i>i.e.</i> l'Angleterre] sçache que vous m'avez
choisy pour vous donner la connaissance d'une langue qui vous manquoit,
qui est si estimée, et si usitée par toute la Terre. . . .</p></div></div>

<p class="noi">Whether these letters were ever actually sent to his pupils
is a question of some uncertainty, which we are inclined to
answer in the affirmative. In any case, they provided him
with an excellent opportunity of advertising himself by calling
attention to some of his well-known pupils. Many were
addressed to friends in France, where he seems to have had a
very good connexion. He closes his collection with a short
selection of commercial letters.</p>

<p>Mauger was the author of several other short works&mdash;a
<i>Livre d'Histoires curieuses du Temps</i>, destined for his pupils'
reading; a <i>Tableau du jugement universal</i> (1675), which sold
so well that there were very few copies left at the end of the
year; and a Latin poem of one hundred and four lines,
entitled <i>Oliva Pacis</i>, celebrating the declaration of peace
between Louis X. of France and Philip II.</p>

<p>Besides many influential friends, he seems to have had
several relatives in London.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> One of these was a Master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">-308-</a></span>Keyser, his brother-in-law, a Dutch gentleman and painter,
who lived in "Long Aker between the Maidenhead and the
Three Tuns Tavern," and acted as a sort of agent for Claude.
Mauger himself lived "in Great Queen Street, over against
Well's Street, next door to the strong water shop," in 1670.
Before 1673 he had moved to "within two doors of Master
Longland, a Farrier in Little Queen St., over against the
Guy of Warwick near the King's Gate in Holborn"; and in
1676 to "Shandois Street, over against the Three Elmes, at
Master Saint André's." It was probably about the year 1670
that he began to teach English to foreigners visiting England.
He had the honour "of helping a little to the English tongue
both the French ambassadors, Ladyes, ambassadresses and
several great Lords, who come daily from the court of France
to the court of England." With many of these he had much
familiar intercourse, and it was at their request that he wrote
his rules for the English language. One of his letters is
addressed to the sharp-witted Courtin, and others to the
Marquis de Sande and Monseigneur Colbert's surgeon. Some
of the numerous French nobility, "who come daily from
the court of France to the court of England," attracted
by the gay and Frenchified court of Charles II., also studied
English under Mauger.</p>

<p>He describes his method of teaching as discursive, "avec
raisonnement." Practice and reading are the chief exercises.
In one of his dialogues a lady pupil describes her
French lesson;<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> it consisted in reading, with special attention
to the pronunciation, and telling a story in French, no doubt
a repetition of the matter read. For the pronunciation,
Mauger considered "the living voice of a master better than
all that can be set down in writing"; but none the less he
provided rules for acquiring the true accent of Blois. He took
little interest in grammar, but fully realized the necessity of
guiding rules; "some man perhaps," he writes, "will answer
me that he speaketh his naturall tongue well enough, without
all these rules. I confesse he may speak reasonably well,
because it is a natural thing for him to do. But you needs
must confesse that a Latine schollar, who hath been acquainted
with all such rules of grammar, speaketh better than such a
one." Mauger would have the student first master his rules,
and then begin "by all means" to read, "pour joindre la
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">-309-</a></span>pratique à la speculation des règles."
<span class="sidenote">MAUGER'S METHOD OF TEACHING</span>He no doubt intended
the student to attempt to speak at the outset with the guidance
of a French master, whom he held absolutely indispensable.
The following talk between two students throws light on the
practical methods advocated:</p>

<p>"My dialogues," writes Mauger, "are so useful and so fit to
learn to speak, that one may easily attain the French tongue
by the assistance of a Master, if he will take a little pains
on his side." He also advises his pupils to read the lengthy
heroical romances so popular at the time&mdash;<i>L'Astrée</i>, and the
enormous folios of De Gomberville, La Calprenède, Mlle. de
Scudéry, and other romances of the same type&mdash;as well as
the works of Corneille, Balzac, and Le Grand. With Antoine
le Grand, Mauger claims personal acquaintance, and recommends
his works with special emphasis, giving his pupils
notice of a book newly published by him: "There is a French
book newly printed at Paris called <i>L'Epicure spirituel</i>, written
in good French by M. Antony le Grand, Author of <i>L'Homme
sans passions</i>. You may have it at Mr. Martyn's shop
[Mauger's publisher] at the sign of the Bell in St. Paul's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">-310-</a></span>Churchyard." He also advocates, for purposes of translation,
the reading of the Bible and Common Prayers in French,
books specially suitable owing to the ease with which English
renderings could be found; and adds further that "at Mr.
Bentley's shop, in Russel St. in Covent Garden, you may
be furnished with French Bibles, French Common Prayers,
French Testaments, and French Psalms." These would be
of special use to his own students, as he encouraged them
to frequent the French Church for the benefit of hearing the
language. As for Mauger himself, although he appears to
have professed the Protestant religion and to have come first
to England as a refugee for the sake of his principles, he does
not seem to have given much attention to religious matters.
Neither does he manifest any particular interest in the
French Church,<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> other than as an excellent place for his
pupils to accustom themselves to the sounds of the French
language.</p>

<p>After he had spent some thirty years in England we find
him moving to Paris, where he was constantly with "some
of the ablest gentlemen of Port Royal," who assured him
that his French Grammar and his Letters in French and
English were in their library. This break in Mauger's long
teaching career in England occurred some time about 1680,
after the appearance of the eighth edition of his grammar in
1679. He now took up his residence in the fashionable
quarter of Paris, usually frequented by foreigners, the
Faubourg St. Germain, where he taught French to English
travellers, and English to any one wishing to learn it. This
change of abode modified his exclusive attitude towards the
Blois accent. At an earlier date he had acknowledged that
"after Blois the best pronunciation is got at Orleans, Saumur,
Tours, and the Court," and in 1676 he writes, "Je suys exactement
le plus beau stile de la Cour," and tells us that he had
daily intercourse with French courtiers "tant ambassadeurs
qu'autres grands seigneurs, à qui j'ay aussi l'honneur de
monstrer la langue angloise." He also read all the latest
books, and carried on a correspondence with learned men in
Paris, among others Antoine le Grand. But in the same year
that he was praising the French of Paris, he wrote, encouraging
a noble Englishman to take up the study of French in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">-311-</a></span>England:
<span class="sidenote">MAUGER IN PARIS</span>"Si vos affaires ne vous permettent pas d'aller à
Paris, pour vous y adonner, de quoy vous souciez-vous si
vous avez Blois dans Londres qui est la source? En effet sa
prononciation ne change jamais: de plus à cause du commerce
qu'il y a entre les deux cours, l'une communique à
l'autre sa pureté. Et je dy assurément qu'il y a icy quantité
de personnes qui parlent aussi bien à la mode qu'au Faubourg
Saint Germain. Et comme les fonteines font couler leurs
eaux bien loin par de bons canaux sans se corrompre, vous
trouverez des Maîtres en cette ville qui vous enseigneront aussi
purement que sur les lieux." However, when he had himself
spent two years in Paris, he gave up praising the merits of
Blois, and always describes himself as "late professor of
languages at Paris," which he now called "the centre of the
purity of the French Tongue, where the true French phrase
is to be found." From this time on his grammar claims to
contain everything that can be desired in order to learn
French as spoken at the Court of France, and "all the improvements
of that Famous Language as it is now flourishing
at the Court of France."</p>

<p>During his stay at Paris, which extended from about 1680
to 1688, the popularity of his grammar in England did not
diminish. Four editions were printed in London after having
been corrected by himself at Paris&mdash;the ninth, tenth, eleventh,
and twelfth. The last was dedicated to the young Earl of
Salisbury, who had studied French with Mauger when on
the usual continental tour.</p>

<p>Three motives, he states, induced him to return to
England, "after having gathered the finest flowers of the
French tongue at Paris to enrich my workes withall for
the better satisfaction of those that learn it: The first the
extream love which I bear to this generous country,<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> that has
obliged me so much as to approve so generally of my books,
that for her sake they are received very well beyond Sea,
and especially in France. The second, to correct the thirteenth
edition my self exactly, many faults of printing having crept
into the four last editions which were Printed here in my
absence though I corrected them at Paris. The third to see
my relations and friends."</p>

<p>After his return to England, he composed his <i>Book of
Curious stories of the Times</i> in French and English for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">-312-</a></span>use of his pupils. The new editions of his grammar, however,
are identical with the thirteenth, which itself bears very great
resemblance to the twelfth issued while Mauger was still at
Paris. How many years he continued to superintend the new
issues of his grammar is not certain; the nineteenth edition
of 1702 is the last described as "corrected and enlarged by
the Author."</p>

<p>Again and again he refers to the popularity of his book in
England, and the "unexpressible courtesies" he received at
the hands of his English patrons. "This grammar sells so well,"
he wrote in the sixth edition (1670), "as you may see, being
printed so often, and many thousands every time, that I
cannot but acknowledge the kindness of this generous nation
towards me in raising its credit both at home and abroad, in
so much that other Nations, following the general approbation
concerning it of so wise a people, use it as commonly everywhere
beyond the Sea, as they do here in London, and in all the
dominions of his majesty of Great Britain." It was also looked
on with much favour in France. In 1689 a French edition,
called the thirteenth, was printed at Bordeaux. But it was
in the Netherlands that the grammar received almost as warm
a welcome as in England. The book thus forms another link
between the study of French in England and the Low Countries.
In 1693 this Dutch edition of the grammar was issued for the
thirteenth time, and in 1707 for the fifteenth, both at the
Hague. It was usually published with an English grammar
of more importance than the short one added by Mauger to
the English editions&mdash;that of Festeau, Mauger's friend and
fellow-townsman. Their combined work was known as the
<i>Nouvelle double grammaire Françoise-Angloise et Angloise-Françoise
par messieurs Claude Mauger et Paul Festeau, Professeurs
de Langues à Paris et à Londres</i>. The two grammars
are followed by Mauger's dialogues and a collection of
twenty-one "plaisantes et facetieuses Histoires pour rire," in
French and English, entitled <i>l'Ecole pour rire</i>. The growing
popularity of English from the beginning of the reign of
William of Orange, the editor tells us in 1693, induced
him to add the English grammar to the French grammar
of Mauger, and he chose Festeau's because it was in as
high favour for learning English as Mauger's was for learning
French.</p>

<p>Paul Festeau was the author of a French as well as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">-313-</a></span>English grammar,<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>
<span class="sidenote">PAUL FESTEAU</span>and, like Mauger, he taught English to
foreign visitors in London, as well as French to English people.
Indeed his career bears a close resemblance to that of Mauger,
of whom he seems to have been a sort of protégé. Like
Mauger he had taught at Blois, and the two teachers probably
came to England together; at any rate they arrived at much
the same time. He enjoyed a greater popularity than Mauger
as a teacher of English, and was also looked upon with respect
as a teacher of French.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>Festeau's French Grammar, first published in 1667, occupies
an important second place among the French text-books
produced in the third quarter of the seventeenth century.
It was dedicated to Colonel Russel, of the King's Guard,
who had learnt French under Festeau's guidance. As a
grammar it is fuller and more clearly arranged than
Mauger's, and, in main outline, there is much similarity
between the two. The rules, which occupy the first two
hundred pages, are written in English and provide information
on pronunciation and on each part of speech in turn. Each
is accompanied by a considerable number of illustrative
examples, which, Festeau thought, were of great help in
impressing the rule on the memory, and of more use
than dialogues. He also included dialogues in his work,
and was attacked on account of their prolixity. He
argued, in reply, that "if the reader pleases to consider
the store of phrases in the body of the Work amongst
the Rules which do contain near two hundred pages, he
will very well apprehend that, when a scholar hath learnt
all these Phrases without book in learning the rules, he
needs not at all burden his memory with many dialogues:
for ... I have found by experience that those who have
learned them were able afterwards to translate French into
English, with the aid of a dictionary and I do maintain that
it is not necessary to learn such abondance of Dialogue by
heart, it is enough to read and English them, and next to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">-314-</a></span>that to explain them from English into French, and so doing
the words and phrases do insensibly make an impression in
the memory and the discreet scholar goeth forward with a
great deal of ease. As for young children I yield that it is
good they should continue the Dialogues: but after they have
learned short phrases, they must of necessity learn long ones,
otherwise they could never attain to the capacity of joyning
words together. Beside when a master doth teach his scholar,
he must not ask him a whole long phrase at once, he must
divide it in parts according to the distinction of points. As
for instance, if I will ask this long phrase of a child | Quand
on a gaigné une fois | le jeu attire insensiblement | en esperance
de gaigner davantage |. I will ask it him at three
several times." Festeau gives the pupil the English in
three separate phrases, and requires him to give the French
rendering. "Them that will take the pains to peruse it,"
to use Festeau's own words in describing his grammar, "will
observe a very new method, clear and intelligible Rules to
the least capacities, fine remarks upon all the parts of speech
and particularly upon the gender of nouns, and the use of
moods and tenses. They will find the difficulties of the
particles, <i>en</i>, <i>on</i>, and <i>que</i> explained, which give commonly so
much trouble to the learner, they will see the use and good
order of impersonal verbs, as well active as passive, likewise
also of the reciprocal and reflected verbs. Finally they will
see familiar dialogues on divers sorts of subjects, very useful
and profitable for them that desire to speak properly: no
barbarous kind of words and phrases as are found in some
other grammars, by reason that the Author professes to speak
and to write his own language well." A vocabulary of thirty
pages, in the style of Mauger's, and rules for the accents and
the length of the vowels fill the rest of the volume. This was how
the work stood in the third edition, which, Festeau explains,
"might rightly be said the fourth, seeing that there was
fifteen hundred copies drawn off the second edition, and two
thousand of this, whereas they use to draw but a thousand
at most: and considering the time it first came out, it seems
that it sells pretty well. If some other former grammars
have had more editions, it cannot be inferred thence that
this comes short of them: we can buy nothing at market
but what is to be sold, and when this hath been in the light
as long, no doubt but (especially being better known) it may
have as many editions." <span class="sidenote">PIERRE LAINÉ</span>Possibly he was referring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">-315-</a></span>
Mauger's popularity, and the two friends may have become
rivals during the latter part of their stay in England. On
similar grounds he claimed that the sixth edition might be
called the tenth, as two thousand copies were drawn of the
four last editions. Mauger, however, states that "many
thousand" copies of his grammar were drawn at every edition.</p>

<p>By this time Festeau's grammar had acquired a considerable
reputation. "The approbation that it hath received," he
writes, "of the most learned of the nation, who have esteemed
it the neatest, the easiest and most correct, is not a small
advantage to it: It is that which hath encouraged me to bring
it to a better perfection." There is, however, very little difference
between the half score or so editions which were issued.</p>

<p>Like Mauger, Festeau soon began to modify his attitude
towards the Blois accent. In 1679, while still advertising
himself proudly as a "native of Blois, where the true tone of
the French Tongue is found by the unanimous consent of
all Frenchmen," he claims to teach the "Elegancy and
Purity of the French Tongue as it is now spoken at the
Court of France." However, it is uncertain whether Festeau
went to Paris or not. At the time when he first wrote of
Court French he was teaching in London, and we are informed
that "if any gentleman have occasion for the author of this
grammar, his Lodging is in the Strand near St. Clement's,
at Mr. John King's house, at the sign of the wounded heart."
He was still there in 1693. In 1675 we see him requesting
any "gentleman or others desiring to speak with him to inquire
for him in Haughton Street, next door to the Joyner's Arms,
near Claire Market," or at Mr. Loundes, his bookseller and
publisher. At about this time he began to teach mathematics
as well as, and by means of French; he was prepared to
instruct gentlemen in all its branches. It was at the request
of several gentlemen, with whom he "did often discourse of
the same in French," that he added to the fourth edition of
his grammar a long dialogue covering the whole field of
mathematics, and giving "a clear and fair idea thereof."</p>

<p>Another French tutor who flourished at the same time as
Mauger, and who wrote a French grammar which, like his,
appeared during the Commonwealth, was Peter Lainé. Lainé
is not very communicative as regards himself; he does not
even tell us from what part of France he came. All we know
of him is that he was a protégé of Robert Paston, to whom he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">-316-</a></span>dedicated his book, and who, no doubt, had been his pupil
for French. Of his grammar he writes, "I here expose to thy
view a work which might rather be counted an Errata than
a book"&mdash;a state of things for which both himself and the
printer were to blame. For his part, he says, he does not
write for the sake of seeing his name in print, or because he
fancies he excels others. "I rather count myself inferior
to the least of them. But the urgent importunities of some
persons whom I have had, and still have the honour to inform
in French, have made me undertake it to satisfie their desires,
and my gratitude."</p>

<p>His sympathy with the Protestants emerges clearly from the
contents of his grammar. Apparently he did not belong to
the Blois group. He differs from them in adopting the new
orthography in which many of the unsounded letters were
omitted. It was a pity to spoil the purity and elegance
of the pronunciation by the old orthography, he thought;
moreover the clear resemblance between the orthography and
the pronunciation renders the language easier to foreigners;
"seeing that we both write and speak any vulgar Tongue to
be understood and to entertain Society, it is in my judgement,
not only convenient but even necessary to bring as near a
conformity betwixt the Tongue and the Pen, as may without
prejudice to the material grounds of our language, afford all
the facility that is possible to those that are strangers to it."
It is curious to recall that Peletier, and other earlier writers,
had, on the contrary, retained the etymological consonants of
the old orthography, with the idea that the foreigner's Latin
would thereby be of greater service to him.</p>

<p>Lainé's <i>Compendious Introduction to the French Tongue,
teaching with much ease, facility and delight, how to attain briefly
and most exactly to the true and modern pronunciation thereof</i>,
is very similar to Mauger's grammar in the distribution of the
matter. Rules for the pronunciation, which as usual are
briefly explained by means of comparison with English sounds,
are followed by observations on each part of speech in turn;<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
finally come familiar phrases "to be used at the first learning
of French," ten long dialogues, and a vocabulary, all in French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">-317-</a></span>and English.
<span class="sidenote">LAINÉ'S DIALOGUES</span>The book closes with what Lainé calls "an
alphabetical rule for the true and modern orthography of that
French now spoken, being a catalogue of very necessary words
never before printed"&mdash;an alphabetical list of words. The
grammatical section of the work is written in English. In
the dialogues he purposely adapts the English to the French
phrase. "I have been more careful," he explains, "in the
whole course of the treatise, to observe the French, then the
English phrase: to the end I might make its signification
more intelligible, to vary less from the sense, and to afford
most delight and more facility to the learner."</p>

<p>According to him, the first thing to be learned by the
student of French are the sounds of the language. He should
commit to memory as many of the familiar phrases as he can
easily retain, and from them pass to the "dialogical discourses."
Their substance is much the same as in Mauger&mdash;polite and
gallant conversations mainly between students of French, talk
and guidance for travellers in France, etc. The following
specimen is from a dialogue between an English gentleman
and his language master:</p>

<div class="table"><table summary="Festeau's dialogue">

</table></div>

<p class="noi">Lainé evidently intended that the dialogues, at least some
of them, should be committed to memory, as well as read and
translated; "after that," he continues, "as his sufficiency
shall permit, he may proceed to Reading any Histories, among
which the Holy Writ ought to have the pre-eminence, had not
divine Providence, and the Eternal Spirit that dictated it,
purposely rejected the affected smoothness and polishedness
of the style." We recall, as we reflect on this strange reason
for rejecting the Holy Scriptures as reading material, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">-318-</a></span>
unenviable reputation the refugees themselves had as regards
literary style. As the Bible is left us "for divine study only,"
Lainé advises his pupils to make use of moral histories for
purposes of reading. Many, he says, have been produced of
late years. Nor did he limit his pupils' choice to these; he
encouraged them to read the heroic romances so popular at
the time&mdash;<i>Artamène ou le grand Cyrus</i> and <i>Clélie</i> by Mlle. de
Scudéry, <i>Cassandre</i> and <i>Cléopâtre</i> by La Calprenède; also
the <i>Poésies spirituelles</i> of Corneille, the commentaries of
Caesar in French, and Scarron's <i>Roman comique</i>. Lighter
fare could be found in the <i>Gazette françoise</i>.</p>

<h3>THE FRENCH TEACHING PROFESSION AND METHODS OF
STUDYING THE LANGUAGE</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">From</span> their very first appearance the voluminous French
romances of the time enjoyed great popularity in England,<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
partly, perhaps, on account of the lack of a supply of similar
works in the vernacular. Several English translations
appeared, but many preferred to read them in the original.
Their importance in the eyes of the French teachers may
also have increased their vogue. They were especially
affected by Charles I.; and when on the eve of his death,
he was distributing a few of his favourite possessions among
his friends, he left the volumes of La Calprenède's <i>Cassandre</i>
to the Earl of Lindsey.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Later on, Pope describing, in his
<i>Rape of the Lock</i>, the adventurous baron in quest of the much-coveted
lock, pictures him imploring Love for help, and
declares he</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">to Love an altar built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of twelve vast French Romances neatly gilt.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the most eager readers of French romances was
Dorothy Osborne. We are enabled to trace part of her
course in reading from the charming letters she wrote to Sir
William Temple, her future husband. They are full of
references to things French, and replete with French words;
she uses English words in a French sense: <i>injury</i> with her
means <i>insult</i>; and she writes to explain that when she said
<i>maliciously</i> she really meant "a French <i>malice</i>, which you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">-320-</a></span>know does not signify the same thing as an English one."
A little note sent to Temple when she was in London, shortly
before their marriage, evidently in answer to one from him,
may be quoted as a specimen of her French, and her total
disregard of spelling and grammar:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Je n'ay guere plus dormie que vous et mes songes n'ont pas estres moins
confuse, au rest une bande de violons que sont venue jouer sous ma fennestre
m'ont tourmentés de tel façon que je doubt fort si je pourrois jamais les
souffrire encore; je ne suis pourtant pas en fort mauvaise humeur et je m'en
voy ausi tost que je serai habillée voire ce qu'il est posible de faire pour
vostre satisfaction; apres je viendré vous rendre conte de nos affairs et quoy
qu'il en sera vous ne sçaurois jamais doubté que je ne vous ayme plus que
toutes les choses du monde.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p></div>
</div>
<p>The French romances were Dorothy's constant companions,
and her letters are full of criticisms of and references to
her favourite passages. She sent the volumes to Temple
by instalments,<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> as she finished them, pressing him for his
opinion. <i>Le Grand Cyrus</i> seems to have been her favourite.
She had also a great admiration for <i>Ibraham ou l'Illustre Bassa</i>,
which, like <i>Polexandre et Cléopâtre</i> and the four volumes of
<i>Prazimène</i>, was her "old acquaintance." <i>Parthenissa</i>, the
English romance in the French style by Lord Broghill, did
not meet with her approval. "But," she confides to Temple,
"perhaps I like it worse for having a piece of <i>Cyrus</i> by me
that I am highly pleased with, and that I would fain have you
read. I'll send it you." As for the English translations of
her favourites, she had no patience with them. They are
written in a language half French and half English, and
so changed that Dorothy, their old friend, hardly recognizes
them in this strange garb.</p>

<p>French romances were not the only French interest Dorothy
Osborne and Temple had in common. They had first
become acquainted while travelling to France, the Osbornes
on their way to join their father at St. Malo, and Temple
setting out on the usual "tour." Temple, apparently,
lingered with his new friends in France, until his father,
hearing of this, ordered him to Paris.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> There he evidently
acquired the knowledge of French which Dorothy playfully
declares a necessary qualification for <i>her</i> husband: for she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">-321-</a></span>could not
<span class="sidenote">PEPYS'S FRENCH BOOKS</span>marry one who "speaks the French he has picked
up out of the old Laws"; or, the other extreme, the "travelled
monsieur whose head is all feather inside and out, that can
talk of nothing but dances and duels, and has courage enough
to wear slashes when every one else dies with cold to see him."<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>Another instance of the popularity of these romances and
other French writings is found in Pepys's <i>Diary</i>.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> Both
Pepys and more particularly his wife, who was the daughter
of a French refugee, were great readers of the romances.
Pepys himself seems to have found them a little tiresome,
and relates how on a certain occasion Mrs. Pepys wearied him
by telling him long stories out of the <i>Grand Cyrus</i>, and how
he hurt her feelings by checking her outpourings. She would
sit up till past midnight reading <i>Cyrus</i> or <i>Polexandre</i>. He
would often stop at his bookseller's to buy French books
for his wife, including <i>L'Illustre Bassa</i> in four volumes, and
<i>Cassandre</i>. One evening she read to him the epistle of <i>Cassandre</i>,
which he pronounced "very good indeed." When
they went to see Dryden's <i>Evening Love, or the Mock Astrologer</i>,
Mrs. Pepys recognized at once its debt to <i>L'Illustre Bassa</i>, and
on the following afternoon "she read in the <i>L'Illustre Bassa</i>
the plot of yesterday's play, which is exactly the same."</p>

<p>His French books seem to have been a great source of
interest to Pepys, and to have served him on many occasions.
Being ill, "taking physique all day," he beguiled the time by
reading "little French romances." He appears to have been
particularly attracted by Sorbière's <i>Voyage en Angleterre</i>,
which on its appearance caused some indignation at the
English Court. Pepys read the book in the year of its publication
(1664).<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> Unfortunately he has not left us a very full
account of the other French books he knew. However, on the
1st May 1666, he writes that he went "by water to Redriffe,
reading a new French book my Lord Bruncker did give me
to-day, <i>L'Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules</i>" [by the Comte de
Bussy], "being a pretty libel against the amours of the
Court of France." Another volume which pleased Pepys was
a "pretty" work, <i>La Nouvelle allégorique</i>, "upon the strife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">-322-</a></span>between rhetorique and its enemies, very pleasant." His
choice of French literature was wide, ranging from Du Bartas,
which he judged "very fine as anything he had seen," to
Helot's "idle roguish book," <i>L'Eschole des Filles</i>, which he
burnt, "that it might not stand in the list of books, nor
among them to disgrace them if it be found."<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>At both Allestry's and Martin's, Pepys's booksellers, there
was a great variety of French and foreign books, which often
tempted him. "To my new bookseller's, Martin's," he writes on
the 10th January 1667-8, "and there did meet with Fournier
the Frenchman, that hath wrote of the sea and navigation,<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>
and I could not but buy him." He was much interested in
French treatises on music,<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> and sent to France for Mersenne's
<i>L'Harmonie Universelle</i>, which he could not get at his bookseller's.
Pepys's friend, William Batelier, brought him "one
or two printed musick books of songs"<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> from France, among
other French books. "Home," he again notes, on the 26th
January 1668, "and there I find Will Batelier hath also sent
the books which I made him bring me out of France, among
others <i>L'Estat de France</i>, <i>Marnix</i>, <i>etc.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> to my great content,
and so I was well pleased with them and shall take a time to
look them over ... but my eyes are now too much out of
tune to look upon them with any pleasure." And when
his failing eyesight prevented him from reading with ease,
his wife, Batelier, and his brother-in-law, Balty St. Michel,
would read to him in French as well as in English. He got
Balty to read to him out of Sorbière's <i>Voyage en Angleterre</i>,
and under the date the 30th of January 1668-9 we find this
entry: "I spent all the afternoon with my wife and Will
Batelier talking, and then making them read, and particularly
made an end of Mr. Boyle's <i>Book of Formes</i>, which I am
glad to have over, and then fell to read a French discourse
which he hath brought over with him for me."</p>

No doubt the polite French literature which the French
teachers recommended so strongly to their pupils had some
influence on the character of the dialogues which form part
of their manuals. Mauger, Festeau, and Lainé all include
polite conversations in their dialogues, and leave the old
familiar subjects of buying and selling, wayside and tavern
talk. Polite conversation was the fashion, and coteries for
fostering it grew up in England on the model of those in
France. Mrs. Katherine Philipps, generally known as "the
matchless Orinda," is perhaps the most prominent of the
ladies who tried, without any permanent success it is true, to
introduce the refinements of the French <i>salons</i> into England.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>
Each member of the "Society of Friendship" she gathered
round her assumed fanciful names in the style of those affected
by the adherents of the Parisian salons. "Orinda" was of
course a great reader of French literature, and knew French
perfectly. She is chiefly remembered for her translations
of some of Corneille's plays into English.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> French books
of conversation, such as Mlle. de Scudéry's <i>Conversations sur
divers sujets</i><a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> or the similar volume by Clerombault, which
was rendered into English by a "person of honour" [1672],
also give some clue to the tastes and tendencies of the time,
though they had no direct influence on the dialogues specially
written for students of French. But, like them, they turn on
such subjects as the pleasures, the passions, the soul, love,
beauty, merit, and so forth. Thus the French teachers of the
time, in introducing a new style into their dialogues, undoubtedly
yielded, to some extent at all events, to the tastes
of their numerous lady pupils. A large proportion of Mauger's
pupils were ladies. He praised their accent, and considered
it clearer and more correct than that of their brothers. And
in the later editions of his treatise the grammar rules are
given in the form of a conversation between a lady and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">-324-</a></span>French master. Another French teacher of the time, the
author of a collection of dialogues in which the new style
is the dominating feature, also shows a decided preference
for his lady pupils. This writer was William or Guillaume
Herbert, the author of the <i>French and English dialogues in a
more exact and delightful method then any yet extant</i>.</p>

<p>The thirty-four dialogues contained in this collection are all,
with the exception of the first which is autobiographical,
written in the <i>précieux</i> style, full of points and conceits,<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> and all,
with the same exception, are very alike and a little wearisome.
Herbert says he does not write for every one, but for "les plus
subtils." And in his first dialogue, which gives a free account
of his condition and opinions, he proceeds to ridicule the
traditional style of the French and English dialogues. A
stranger addresses a friend of the author:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Pourquoi ne parle-t-il point de vendre et d'acheter?</p>

<p>Parce qu'il n'a rien à vendre et que fort peu d'argent pour acheter; et

<p>Pourquoi ne dit-il rien du Manger et du Boire?</p>

<p>Pour tant qu'il y prend fort peu de plaisir, faute d'appétit, et que quelques-uns

<p>Parce qu'ils ont assez d'esprit pour ne s'oublier pas: et assez de langue

passionément plusieurs personnes de ces trois états, pour leurs rares mérites.</p></div></div>

<p>Qu'en diroit-il, les siens lui étant si peu courtois? S'il parloit d'eux,

<p>Herbert, it will be seen, had not a very high opinion of the
social origin or ability of the majority of his fellow-teachers.
He was a very unwilling member of the profession. He does
not style himself "Professor of the French Language" on
the title-page of his dialogues, although he taught both in
his house and away from home, because few people care to
boast of their cross, and his cross was&mdash;to be reduced to
belong to a profession "que tant de valets, de mécaniques,
et d'ignorants rendent tous les jours méprisable." He draws
a far from flattering picture of the common sort of French
teacher. He is a "brouillon," a shuffling fellow, who boasts,
dresses well, and intrudes everywhere, cringing and offering
his services at a cheaper price than the genuine teachers.
He can hardly write seven or eight lines of French correctly.
Yet men such as this, says Herbert, pass for first-class teachers,
and some take upon themselves to correct and write books.
What is more, they count many pupils, even among the nobility.</p>

<p>Yet another cause of annoyance to Herbert was what
seemed to him the presumption of the Blois fraternity. It
is the fashion, he remarks scornfully, to say you come from
Blois. And you do so if you happen to come from Normandy.
He is not ashamed of his province, though he takes good care
not to advertise it needlessly; Brittany (of which he was
evidently a native) is better than Blois, according to him.
Thus we may conclude that Herbert was one of the 'enemies'
to whom members of the Blois group frequently allude.
Festeau refers to them as being ignorant and envious persons,
while Mauger describes them foaming with envy and jealousy,
and trying to harm him in the eyes of his pupils, as well as
casting aspersions on his grammar;<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> but he did not regard
what they said, England having raised his grammar so high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">-326-</a></span>that "their envy cannot reach to it." And Mauger goes on
to censure a certain section of the French teaching profession,
"broken Frenchmen," who make their pupils speak rapidly,
but not distinctly. "Have a speciall care," he exclaims,
"that you have not to do with those that are not true Frenchmen
as your Normans or Gascons. I confesse that a Norman
that is a man of some quality or one that hath seen the world
or that is a good scholar may possibly have the right accent,
but any other that hath not such parts can never give the
true accent." Herbert retorted that the Blois clique tried
to persuade every one that Bretons and Normans cannot
speak correct French. He naturally resented such assertions,
and was not himself nearly so exclusive in the list of those
who were not "good Frenchmen." He merely states that the
English are greatly mistaken in their estimation of the French
living here, "considering as such all those that speak their
tongue, so that the high Germans, Switzers of the French tongue,
Danes, Swedes, Dutch, Walloons, and those of Geneva pass for
good French in the opinion of many, although in truth there
are not here two naturall French 'mongst ten, which are taken
for such, and who for their profit would gladly go for such."</p>

<p>There was every need, thought Herbert, of protecting the
profession from these incompetent teachers. Before a tutor is
engaged he should be made to translate a passage from a good
author from English into French, and then from French into
English, and both the pieces should be examined by competent
judges of both languages; for, according to him, a
teacher must know English, or some other language with
which the scholar is acquainted, such as Latin, so that there
may be some foundation on which to build the new edifice.</p>

<p>Beyond the importance he attached to translation, we know
little of Herbert's ideas on the teaching of French. He
devotes more space to criticizing the teachers. He does tell
us, however, that French orthography is best learnt by transcribing
French passages, by which operation it impresses
itself on the mind without effort. He was also an advocate
of much and careful reading. Grammatical rules he considered
necessary, and he had intended to publish a grammar
together with his dialogues, but he was prevented from doing
so by illness. He hoped, however, to issue it a few months
later, but apparently he was again prevented from carrying
out his design. Yet two years after the appearance of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">-327-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">GUILLAUME HERBERT</span>dialogues he published another work but of quite a different
character&mdash;<i>Considerations on the behalf of Foreiners which reside
in England, and of the English who are out of their own country,
to allay the tempest which is too often raised in the minds of
the vulgar sort, and to sweeten the bitterness of a bilious or
cholerick humour against strangers</i>, in which he showed "that
of all the Nations of Europe, the English and French should
love one another best, as well for their vicinity as for the
great commerce that is 'mongst them in time of peace, and
for their consanguinitie, there being in this country thousands
of families which are descended from the French, and as
many or more in France whose progenitours are English."
These 'considerations,' twenty in number, are mainly a plea
in favour of the foreign churches in England and of the liberty
of aliens to trade and work in this country, with an allusion
to the "good usage of neighbouring Nations" towards the
English fugitives of Mary's reign. They are dated from the
Charterhouse, June 1662, and appear to have been the only
work Herbert published after his <i>Dialogues</i>. He had, however,
previously shown his interest in the teaching of French
by editing in 1658 the fourth edition of Cogneau's <i>Sure Guide
to the French Tongue</i>,<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> which consisted largely of the style
of dialogue which he ridiculed at a later date.</p>

<p>Herbert had had a long career in England before we first
hear of him as a teacher of French. He had composed
treatises in French and in English, both of which he wrote
with equal facility. His language gives no clue to his
nationality, but, as we saw, we may conclude from his autobiographical
dialogue that he was a native of Brittany. He
was, no doubt, the William Herbert, native of France, who
received a grant of letters of denization in 1636. At that
date he was living at Pointington, Somerset, and was married
to an Englishwoman, Frances Sedgwicke. In the previous
year he had prepared for the press a work in French called
<i>La Mallette de David</i>.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> How he spent his time in Pointington
is not clear, but in 1640 he was tutor to the sons of Montague
Bertie, second Earl of Lindsey. On the death of his wife
in 1645 he moved to London, and published a number of
devotional works in English, which he had composed at
Pointington, chiefly for the benefit of his wife and children.
He refers to the unfavourable reception of these compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">-328-</a></span>in his French and English dialogues, which he hoped would
meet with a better fate.</p>

<p>Herbert also took a great interest in the foreign churches
of London. He dedicated his <i>Quadripartit Devotion</i> of 1648
to the "learned, pious, and reverend Pastors, Elders, and
Deacons of all the French and Dutch congregations in England."
At a later date he published a biting pamphlet against a
French Pastor, Jean Despagne,&mdash;the <i>Réponse aux Questions
de Mr. Despagne adressées à l'Eglise Françoise de Londres</i>
(1657), accusing "le ridicule Despagne" of blasphemy and
immorality, as well as criticising his French. In this work
Herbert agrees with Lainé in omitting a number of superfluous
letters, with the intention of facilitating reading for foreigners,
though he was opposed to too many changes, for fear of
offending the partisans of the old orthography. The <i>Dialogues</i>
and the <i>Considerations in behalf of Strangers</i> were the two
works issued subsequently to the attack on Despagne, and
with them ends all we know of the career of Herbert, critic
of the French teaching profession, and earliest advocate of
the "registration" of teachers.</p>

<p>The Jean Despagne attacked so bitterly by Herbert was
none the less a welcome guest in this country, and was the
only truly French minister in London during the Commonwealth.
English as well as French, attracted by his excellent
sermons, gathered round him. Thus he co-operated in a
sense, and no doubt unconsciously, with Mauger and the
other French teachers of the time, who were busy encouraging
their pupils to attend the French church. Despagne was
minister, not of the old church of Threadneedle Street, but
of a new congregation in Westminster, which met at first in
Durham House in the Strand, and when that was pulled down,
at the chapel in Somerset House (1653).<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> He held aloof
from the older church, and went so far as to criticise Calvin.
He was attacked and accused of schism, but was protected
by his powerful patrons, chief among whom was the Earl of
Pembroke. An important group of the royalist English
nobility and gentry found in Despagne a means of satisfying
their religious needs when the Anglican church was in abeyance.
Among them was the diarist John Evelyn, who heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">-329-</a></span>Despagne preach in the Savoy church.
<span class="sidenote">THE FRENCH CHURCHES</span>Another adherent,
and a very faithful one, was a certain Henry Brown, who, in
his English translation of one of Despagne's works,<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> speaks
of the great resort of the English nobility and gentry to the
"excellent sermons and Doctrines" of the French pastor.
Many continued to attend after the Restoration, Evelyn
among others; as late as 1670 he remarks that "a 'stranger'
preached at the Savoy French church, the liturgie of the
Church of England being now used altogether, as translated
into French by Dr. Durell."</p>

<p>The Savoy church had been authorized by Charles II.
at the Restoration on condition that the English Liturgy in
French should be used. The Threadneedle Street church,
on the contrary, continued to use the Calvinistic 'discipline,'
and regarded with jealousy and suspicion the church rising
in Westminster. It refused all co-operation, and endeavoured
to bring about the suppression of the new church. The
Savoy church benefited on account of its situation in the
fashionable residential quarter, while Threadneedle Street
was away in the city. Consequently many members of the
English aristocracy and gentry continued to frequent the
Westminster church even after the Restoration. The use
of the Anglican Liturgy was no doubt an additional attraction.
When service was opened there in 1661, by J. Durel,<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>
among the English present were the Duke and Duchess of
Ormond, the Countess of Derby and her daughters, the Earl
of Stafford, and the Dukes of Newcastle and Devonshire.
Indeed the English gentry seem to have occupied the attention
of the French churches just as much as the refugees
themselves. The Threadneedle Street church felt the advantages
of its Westminster rival in this respect, and at the
Restoration, offered to establish a French Sabbath Lecture
at Westminster for those of the English gentry and French
Protestants who found Threadneedle Street too remote,
hoping by this means to prevent division by having a separate
church there.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> The Threadneedle Street church, however,
was not without its English adherents. Pepys went from
time to time to both French churches, but more frequently
to Threadneedle Street, as far as can be gathered from his
diary, where he does not always specify which of the churches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">-330-</a></span>is meant. "At last I rose," he writes on the 28th September
1662, "and with Tom to the French church at the Savoy,
where I never was before; a pretty place it is; and there
they have the Common Prayer Book read in French, and
which I never saw before, the minister do preach with his
hat off, I suppose in further conformity with our Church."
Pepys as a rule went to the Anglican church in the morning,
and to the French in the afternoon. He usually has a very
good word for the sermon, though on one occasion it was
so "tedious and long that they were fain to light candles
to baptize the children by." There were also services held
at the French ambassador's, which many of the nobility
attended, as well as French sermons at Court from time to
time. Evelyn was present on one of these occasions: "At
St. James's chapel preached, or rather harangued, the famous
orator, Monsieur Morus, in French. There were present the
King, the Duke, the French ambassador Lord Aubigny, the
Earl of Bristol, and a world of Roman Catholics, drawn
thither to hear this eloquent Protestant." This was on the
12th of January 1662. At a much later date, September 1685,
he heard another Frenchman, "who preached before the King
and Queene in that splendid chapell next St. George's Hall."</p>

<p>It appears therefore that the practice, common among
French teachers, of urging their pupils to go to the French
church, met with some response, as did their advice as regards
the reading of French literature. On both these points
the teachers of the middle of the seventeenth century are at
one with those of the sixteenth, and, as a general rule, there
is very little difference between the methods used in the two
centuries. Reading remained the basis of the teaching;
dialogues were committed to memory and translated into
English, less importance being attached to retranslation into
French in later times. As for pronunciation, the teachers of
the seventeenth century realised the inadequacy of teaching
it by comparison with English sounds; they laid all the more
emphasis on the services of a good tutor, continuing, none
the less, to supply certain rules, though not without a warning.
As time went on, more importance was attached to the
grammar, which, though still limited in theory to essential
general rules, was often studied in the first place, and not
left till need for it arose in practice. The general opinion
is thus expressed by James Howell: "What foundations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">-331-</a></span>are
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH BY "GRAMMAR AND ROTE"</span>to material fabriques the same is grammar to a language.
If the foundation be not well laid, 'twill be but a poor tottring
superstructure; if grammatical rules go not before, there is
no language can be had in perfection. Yet there are no
precepts so punctuall, but much must be left to observation,
which is the grand Mistresse that guides and improves the
understanding in the research and poursute of all humane
knowledge, <i>Quod deficit in praecepto, suppleat observatio.</i>"
Students who learnt on this method, called a combination of
"grammar and rote," would read aloud with their tutor,
chiefly for practice in pronunciation; study the principal
grammar rules and commit to memory the vocabulary of
familiar phrases, and a few short dialogues; read and translate<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>
French dialogues, and then pass to the favourite French
authors; sometimes they would translate from English into
French, or write French letters; finally they would converse
as much as possible with their tutor, repeat stories they had
read in French, and seize every opportunity of speaking the
language and hearing it spoken.</p>

<p>Such was the method employed by the more serious French
teachers of the time. There were, however, others, and
apparently very many, who taught "by rote" alone without
any grammar rules&mdash;a common method of learning modern
languages. "In England, the French, Spanish, and Italian
Languages are not the languages of our country, and spoke
only by few Persons, yet 'tis evident they are taught in
London, and several other places in the Kingdom, purely by
conversation." "For it is well known," argues a writer on
education,<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> "that there are Grammars writ for the French,
Italian, and Spanish languages, and yet notwithstanding,
these Languages are learned by Conversation ... little
children, who know not what Grammar means, are bred up
to speak foreign languages fluently and correctly.... There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">-332-</a></span>are some indeed, in England that teach Modern Languages
by Grammar. But this is not at all necessary, as is unanswerably
evident from those Persons who perfectly learn
them without it. However, those who reach the Modern
Languages by Grammar only teach their scholars so much
of it as to know how to decline Nouns and Verbs and understand
some few rules. For as for the Languages themselves,
they are generally taught not by Books but Conversation,
which is found by experience to be much the readiest, easiest,
and best Method of teaching them.... Some by great
application have learn'd French or Italian in half a year's
time by conversation, and indeed any foreign Tongue is
ordinarily taught in a year or a year and a half. And such
as are two years in learning any of them are accounted either
very negligent or else very incapable of retaining them.... Men
who know little or nothing of French, Italian, or Spanish,
quickly learn any one of these languages only by going twice
or thrice a week to a club where they are obliged to speak it."</p>

<p>How common such practical methods of learning French
were may be gathered from the fact that the few memoirs
and similar writings which give any detail on the subject
invariably mention them. For instance, the mother of Mrs.
Hutchinson, the wife of the regicide and Governor of Nottingham,
was sent to board in the house of a refugee minister in
order to learn French.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> As to Mrs. Hutchinson herself, she
had a French nurse, and was taught to speak English and
French together.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> Others had tutors. Thus the mother of
Lady Anne Halkett, the royalist and writer on religious subjects,
paid masters to teach Lady Anne and her sister "to write,
speak French, play on the lute and virginals and dance";<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
and Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, held up by
Mrs. Makin as an example to "all ingenious and Vertuous
Ladies," also had tutors for the polite accomplishments, and
refers to her language lessons as "prating."<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> She acquired
a good knowledge of French, became attendant to Queen
Henrietta Maria, and accompanied her in her exile in France.</p>

<p>An example of the opportunities of acquiring a knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">-333-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH BY CONVERSATION</span>of French, "in any leisure hour," as Milton said of Italian,
is found in the Letters of Robert Loveday, the translator of
part of La Calprenède's <i>Cléopâtre</i>. Loveday lived during
the Commonwealth as a dependent in the house of Lady
Clinton at Nottingham, where, he says, French "was familiarly
spoken by the best sort of the family."<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> He therefore had
every opportunity of learning the language, and was much
helped by an old Italian gentleman, skilled in French, who
was living in the house on the same footing as himself. As
a result of his application he was able to translate several
French works into English "in those empty spaces of time
which were left by those that command me at my disposall."
He procured a copy of Cotgrave's dictionary and asked a
friend in London to make enquiries at the booksellers if
there was "any new French book of indifferent volume
that was worth the translating and not enterprised by any
other."<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> Loveday hoped by this means to give "larger
scope to (his) narrow condition" at Nottingham. One of
his first enterprises was the translation of a "mad fantastick
Dream" he met with in Sorel's <i>Francion</i>, which he sent to
his brother; but his chief work was a rendering of the first
three parts of <i>Cléopâtre</i>, which was hardly of the "indifferent
size" he writes of. The several parts appeared in 1652, 1654,
and 1655 respectively, under the title of <i>Hymen's Praeludia,
or Love's Masterpiece</i>, and were dedicated to his "ever-honoured
lady" Lady Clinton. In the complete version, the
fourth, fifth, and sixth parts are also ascribed to Loveday.</p>

<p>Thus practical methods gained a firm hold in the teaching
of French; when grammar was studied, it was within
limited boundaries, and only so far as desirable for practical
purposes. In the teaching of Latin, on the other hand,
more and more importance was attached to the study of
grammar, which took the foremost place, literature being
regarded as little more than a collection of illustrative
examples of the rules.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> Grammar had become "a full swolen
and overflowing stream, which, by a strong hand, arrogates to
itself (and hath well-nigh gotten) the whole traffic in learning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">-334-</a></span>especially of languages."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> The use of the Grammar and
reading books in Latin alone was another practice which
engaged the attention of the reformers.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> "A book altogether
in Latin is a mere Barbarian to our children," wrote Charles
Hoole,<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> who published many of the popular Latin school-books
with English translations, in the style of those which are
always present in the French text-books. His opinion was
that "no language is more readily got than by familiar discourse
in it, and ability therein is in no way sooner gained
then by comparing the tongue we learn with that we know,
and asking how they call this or how they say that in another
language, which we are able to express in our own." A
writer of the time<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> thus describes "that wild goose chase
usually led": "ordinarily boys learn a leaf or two of the
Pueriles, twenty pages of Corderius, a part of Esop's Fables,
a piece of Tullie, a little of Ovid, a remnant of Virgil, Terence,
etc. ... to read the accidence, to get it without book, is
ordinarily the work of one whole year. To construe the
Grammar and to get it without book is at least the task of
two years more, and then, it may be, it is little understood
until a year or two more is spent in making plain Latin ...
when it is all done, besides declining nouns and forming verbs
and getting a few words, there is very little advantage to the
child." And a French teacher,<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> writing at about the same
time, has left a very similar picture. He describes how the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">-335-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">GRAMMATICAL STUDY OF LANGUAGES</span>child slaves till the age of fifteen or sixteen, forced to learn
against his will a little Latin and Greek, with little result after
seven or eight years of hardship. "Not 10 per cent really
know either; they are buried under a <i>fatras</i> of words and
rules, which stun the memory and overturn the judgment,
and all under the rule of the rod." Such is the learning of a
foreign language "by grammar."</p>

<p>The feeling of dissatisfaction with the usual method of
teaching Latin in grammar schools, however, seems to have
been general in the seventeenth century, and many were the
protests and appeals for reform. "No man can run speedily
to the mark of languages that is shackled and ingiv'd with
grammar precepts," wrote Joseph Webbe,<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> who draws a
careful distinction between the grammar-Latin thus acquired
and what he calls Latin-Latin,<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> that is, "Such as the best
approved authors wrote and left us in their books and monuments
of use and custom," as distinct from "that Latin which
we now make by grammar rules, and their collection out of
that custom and those authors was to make us write and
speak such Latin as that custom and those authors did, which
was Latin-Latin, but it succeeded not."</p>

<p>Consequently there arose a belief that "practice"&mdash;in
speaking, reading, and writing the language&mdash;should take its
place by the side of grammar. Writers pleaded, in the style
of Elyot and Ascham, for the teaching of Latin on more
practical lines, quoting Montaigne's experience.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> Thomas
Grantham<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> opened a private school, in which he sought to
deliver youth from their "great captivity" and the hardship
and uselessness of learning grammar word for word without
book and in Latin, which the boy does not understand,
"just as if a man should teach one an art in French when
he understands not French." Grantham, on the contrary,
taught his scholars to understand the rules first, and by
repeatedly applying them they came to know them without
book, whether they would or no. Similar was the method of
the French teachers, who often carried the idea further, and
taught their pupils the rules as need for them arose in practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">-336-</a></span>John Webster thus puts the case for and against learning
by "rule." "As for grammar," he says,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> "which hath been
invented for the more certain and facile teaching and obtaining
of languages, it is very controvertible whether it perform the
same in the surest, easiest and shortest way or not, since
hundreds speak their mother tongue and other languages
very perfectly, use them readily, and understand them excellent
well, and yet never knew or were taught any grammar
rules, nor followed the wayes of Conjugations and Declensions,
Noun or Verb. And it is sufficiently known that many men,
by their own industry, without the method or rules of grammar,
have gotten a competent understanding in divers languages:
and many unletter'd persons will, by use and exercise, without
Grammar rules, learn to speak and understand some languages
in far shorter time than any do learn them by method
and rule, as is clearly manifest by those that travel....
And again, if we conceive that languages learnt by use and
exercise render men ready and expert in the understanding
and speaking of them, without any aggravating or pushing
the intellect and memory, when that which is gotten by rule
and method, when we come to use and speak it, doth exceedingly
rack and excruciate the intellect and memory:
which are forced at the same time, not only to find fit words
agreeable to the present matter discoursed of, and to put
them into a good Rhetorical order, but must at the same
instant of speaking, collect all the numerous rules of number,
case ... as into one centre, where so many rayes are united
and yet not confounded, which must needs be very perplexive
and gravaminous to memorative faculty: and therefore none
that attains languages by grammar do ever come to speak
and understand them perfectly and readily, until they come to
a perfect habit in the exercitation of them, and so thereby
come to lose and leave the use of those many and intricate
rules, which have cost us so many pains to attain to them,
and so to justifie the saying that we do but <i>discere dediscenda</i>."
Those who learn by "use and exercitation," on the other
hand, acquire languages more quickly and with better results.
If the study of grammar is insisted on, it should be made very
brief. The indeclinables require no rules, but are learnt by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">-337-</a></span>use.
<span class="sidenote">LOCKE ON THE TEACHING OF FRENCH</span>Of the declinables the only ones that present any difficulties
are the noun and the verb, regular and irregular. As to
the irregulars, they are best learnt by "use," as rules only
"render the way more perplexed and tedious. And the way of
the regulars is facile and brief, being but one rule for all."</p>

<p>Many others wrote in a similar strain,<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> advocating the
teaching of Latin on lines widely used in the teaching of
French. Several actually specified the modern language,
which was first mentioned in books on education in this
connexion. Thomas Grantham, in his <i>Brain Breaker's
Breaker</i> (1644), points out that many young gentlemen and
ladies learn to speak French in half a year without grammar,
and argues that the same purpose could be achieved with Latin
and Greek in a twelvemonth. Similarly George Snell argued
that Latin might be learnt "in as short a time as a Monsieur
can teach French,"<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> for the pronunciation, so great a task
in learning the living tongue, is of no importance in the dead
language. At a somewhat later date, when French had made
more headway in the scholastic world, Locke plainly states
that people are accustomed to the right way of teaching
French, "which is by talking it into children by constant
conversation, and not by Grammatical Rules,"<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> and proposes
that the same method should be applied to Latin. "When
we so often see a Frenchwoman teach an English girl to speak
and read French perfectly in a year or two, without any rule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">-338-</a></span>of grammar, or anything else but prattling to her, I cannot
but wonder how gentlemen have overseen this way for their
sons, and thought them more dull and incapable than their
daughters."<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> Elsewhere Locke again draws comparisons
between the teaching of Latin and that of French,<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> and a
French teacher of the early part of the eighteenth century
recognized the importance of this tribute when he published
a grammar intended to confirm the knowledge acquired by
"practice."<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<p>Yet all these proposals and protests do not seem to have
had much effect on the teaching of Latin. In a few cases,
however, experiments were attempted, usually in connexion
with French. Several were made with the <i>Janua</i> of Comenius,
which had early been adapted to the teaching of
French as well as Latin. The theories of Comenius himself
had no doubt inspired the English reformers. He had written
that rules are thorns to the understanding, that no one ever
mastered a language by precept alone, though it is often done
by practice; rules, however, should not be entirely discarded.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>J. T. Philipps, who was later tutor to the Duke of Cumberland,
son of George II., relates<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> how he taught both Latin and
French on practical lines with the help of Comenius. His
pupil first got a good notion of the Latin tongue by studying
the verbs and nouns, and then learning the Latin column of
the <i>Janua Linguarum</i>. "I likewise at som leisure Hours,"
continues Philipps, "taught him to read French and when
he had good the pronunciation, he labour'd for some time, as
he did before in the Latin, to make himself Master of the
French Verbs and Nouns, and then began to learn the sentences
in another column of the <i>Janua Linguarum</i>, which,
by the assistance of the Latin, he mastered in a very short
time. So that before the end of the first year, he could read
Fontaine's <i>Fables</i> from French into English, and give me an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">-339-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">LANGUAGES LEARNT WITHOUT GRAMMAR</span>account of the French Minister's text which he heard, and
part of the sermon; for I charg'd him never to miss the French
Church, that he might the better accustom himself to the true
Accent of that Tongue.... I spent an hour every Sunday
Morning all the time the Boy was with me, to read over several
short Catechisms or systems in Divinity both in French and
Latin."<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>The learned Mrs. Bathsua Makin, who had been governess
to the daughters of Charles I., and later kept a school at Tottenham
High Cross, also advocated the use of the <i>Janua Linguarum</i>
for learning Latin and French. The young ladies
of her school learnt ten Latin sentences of the <i>Janua</i> a day
thoroughly, spending "but six hours a day in their books."
By the end of six months they had a fair knowledge of the
language, and turned to French: "If the Latin tongue
may be learnt in 6 months, where most of the words are
new, then the French may be learnt in three, by one that
understands Latin and English, because there is not above
one word of ten of the French Tongue, that may not fairly,
without force, be reduced to the Latin or English."<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>We are also told<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> of a boy of seven who spoke Latin,
French, and English with equal facility, "by reason that
his father talked to him in nothing but Latin, and his mother,
who was a Frenchwoman, in nothing but French, and the
rest of the family in nothing but English." And the Rev.
Henry Wotton of Corpus Christi, Cambridge, has left an
account of how, when he undertook the education of his son,
"leaving off the Accidence in that Method that ordinarily
children are trained up in, (he) immediately thought with
(him)self to make an experiment whether children of his
years might not be taught the Latin Tongue as ordinarily
children are taught the French and Italian, and without the
torture of grammar, to make them, by reading a Latin book,
to understand Nouns and Verbs, Declensions and Moods,
and that without the vast circuit, that ordinarily takes up
3 or 4 years, as preparatory to read any Latin author."<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">-340-</a></span>Evelyn bears witness to the success of Wotton's experiment.
He saw the young William Wotton in London at the age of
eleven, and pronounced him "a miracle."<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> To Evelyn also
we are indebted for an account of another case of similar
precocity due to the same method. He relates how he and
Pepys saw a child of twelve, the son of one Dr. Clench, "who
was perfect in the Latine authors, spake French naturally, and
possessed amazing knowledge. His tutor was a Frenchman,
who had not troubled him to learn even the rules of grammar
by heart, but merely read to him, first in French, and then
in Latin."<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p>In no case, however, was the contrast between the prevalent
methods of teaching Latin and French so marked as in the
learning of Latin in Grammar Schools, and of French in France
by "rote" or with the help of a few general grammar rules;
the older the student, the more necessary were grammar rules
considered. Richard Carew, for instance, was struck by the
fact that he learnt more French without rules in three-quarters
of a year in France than he had learnt Latin in more than
thirteen years' strenuous study of grammar. He had gone
to France on leaving the university. On his arrival he was
at a loss for words, knowing nothing of the language; but
after a short stay, spent in the midst of French people, talking
and reading nothing but French, he surmounted the difficulties
of the language with surprising ease, and wished students of
Latin to benefit by his experience.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> The two languages,
indeed, were not infrequently studied together by the considerable
number of English children who were sent to France
for purposes of education.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_858_858" id="Footnote_858_858"></a><a href="#FNanchor_858_858"><span class="label">[858]</span></a> There was a strong feeling at this period in favour of a freer use of English
in the teaching of Latin, chiefly on account of the time such a course would save.
Thus Milton recognized the mistake of spending a great number of years in
learning one language "making two labours of one by learning first the accidence,
then the grammar in Latin, ere the language of those rules be understood." The remedy,
he thought, was the use of a grammar in English (A. F. Leach, "Milton as Schoolboy and
Schoolmaster," <i>Proceedings of the British Academy</i>, iii. 1908). Snell (<i>Right Teaching of
Useful Knowledge</i>, 1649), Mrs. Makin or M. Lewis (?) (<i>Essay to Revive the Antient
Education of Gentlewomen</i>, 1671), and others also argued that English should be the
groundwork of the teaching of Latin. Most of the English grammars produced in the
seventeenth century claim to be useful to scholars as an introduction to the rudiments
of Latin; and it was on this footing, no doubt, that English grammar first made its way
into the schools. Chief among these, perhaps, was J. Poole's <i>English Accidence for
attaining more speedily the Latin Tongue, so that every young child, as soon as he can
read English, may by it turn any sentence into Latin. Published by Authority, and
commended as generally necessary to be made use of in all schooles of this commonwealth</i>,
London, 1655. For a list of English grammars cp. F. Watson, <i>Modern Subjects</i>, chap. i.
Lily's Grammar came to be almost always used with the English rendering by Wm.
Hume. Cp. Watson, <i>Grammar Schools</i>, p. 296.</p></div>

parts of learning</i> (1648), argues that languages should be taught by "incomparably
more easy wayes then are now usuall." An anonymous "Lover of his Nation" proposed
that children should learn Latin as they do English, by having no other language within
their hearing for two years; and similarly with other languages (Watson, <i>Modern
Subjects</i>, p. 482). Ch. Hoole, teacher at a private grammar school in London, also
proposes that Latin should be learnt by speaking and hearing it spoken, and attributes
the unsatisfactory knowledge of the language to the too frequent use of English in
schools (<i>New Discoverie of the old art of Teaching Schooll</i>, 1660). The French teacher
Miège suggests that Latin should be taught in special schools, on the same lines as
French was taught in the French ones (<i>French Grammar</i>, 1678). In 1685 was published
<i>The Way of Teaching the Latin Tongue by use to those that have already learn'd their
Mother Tongue</i>; and in 1669 had appeared a work translated from the French, called
<i>An Examen of the Way of Teaching the Latine Tongue to little children by use alone</i>.
Among other publications of similar import are: <i>An Essay on Education, showing
how Latin, Greek, and other Languages may be learn'd more easily, quickly and perfectly
than they commonly are</i>, 1711; and <i>An Essay upon the education of youth in Grammar
Schools in which the Vulgar Method of Teaching is examined, and a new one proposed for

<h3>THE TOUR IN FRANCE</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now methinks I see a youth advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready prepared to make the tour of France.<br /></span></div></div>
<p class="center"><i>Satire against the French</i>, 1691.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">When</span>, in the middle of the seventeenth century, England
was torn in twain by civil war and party quarrels, even the
Puritans willingly sent their children to be brought up in
France. It was at this period that Thomas Grantham, a
severe critic of the usual method of teaching Latin in Grammar
Schools,<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> wrote this significant passage: "Let a boy of seven
or eight years of age be sent out of England into France: he
shall learn in a twelvemonth or less to write and speak the
French tongue readily, although he keep much company
with English, read many English books, and write many
English letters home, and all this with pleasure and delight."
The number of English children in France at this period was
considerable.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> At St. Malo, for instance, when proceedings
were taken against the English in the town, the chief victims
were the "English boys sent to learn French."<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<p>The memoirs of the Verney family afford a detailed picture
of one of the numerous families of royalist sympathies, cut
off from English public school and university life, and brought
up in France. Sir Ralph Verney had taken the side of Parliament
in the long struggle, but in 1643 went into voluntary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">-342-</a></span>exile in France rather than sign the Covenant. He settled
at Blois with his family, and procured French tutors for his
boys. Apparently he had some trouble at first, one of the
tutors being dismissed "for drinking, lying and seeking to
proselytise." Finally the education of the boys was entrusted
to the Protestant pastor, M. Testard, who received
foreign pupils. The young students worked hard at Latin
and French under the minister's supervision. Testard reported
of Edmund, the elder, "Il fait merveille. . . . Je luy
raconte une histoire en français, il me la rend extempore en
Latin."<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> And one day Mme. Testard found the young John
hard at work in bed in the early morning with two books in
French and Latin. The children wrote in French to their
mother when she was absent in England making valiant and
finally successful attempts to get the sequestration taken off
Sir Ralph's estate. And when, after her death, Sir Ralph
sought to divert his mind by travelling in Italy, Edmund,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>
then aged thirteen, wrote this letter&mdash;which shows clearly
the dangers of a purely oral method:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div lang="fr"><p>Plust à Dieu qu'il vous donnast la pensée de retourner à Blois. Les
jours me semblent des années tant il m'ennuye d'ettre icy comme dans un
desert de solitude; car quoy est cequi me peut desormais plaire dans cette
ville, comment est ceque cette lumiere de la vie, et cette respiration de l'air
me peuvent-elle estre agreeables, puisqu'y ayant perdu cequi m'estoit le
plus au Monde et qu'il m'interesse plus q'une seule personne dont je suis
privé de l'honneur de sa presence, au reste, graces a Dieu, nous nous porte
fort bien et pourcequi et de moy je vous asseure que je ne manqueray
jamais à mon devoir, c'espourquoy finissant je demeure et demeureray
aternellement,</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="i5">Votre tres humble et fidel fils,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">
<span class="smcap">Edmond Verney</span>.</span>
</p></div></div>

<p>Sir Ralph had also in his charge two girls, his young cousins,
whom their mother had entrusted to him: "Sweet nephew,
I have after A long debate with my selfe sent my tow gurles
where I shall desier youre care of them, that they may be
tought what is fite for them as the reding of the french tong,
and to singe, and to dance and to right and to playe of the
gittar."<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>Sir Ralph regarded France as "the fittest place to breed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">-343-</a></span>up youth."
<span class="sidenote">SIR RALPH VERNEY'S VIEWS</span>"I wish peace in France for my children's sake,"
he wrote to M. Du Val, a French tutor. After bringing up
his own family there, he would have liked to send his grandchildren
to France with a sober and discreet governor, rather
than to any school in England; but his son Edmund thought
the advantage of learning to speak French fluently did not
compensate for the loss of English public school life, which
he himself had never enjoyed. Sir Ralph soon became a
versatile source of information to parents desiring details
of the cost of living and education in France. He considered
£200 a year a proper allowance for an English youth to be
boarded in a good French family, and that homes in which
there were children were best, on account of the continual
prattle of the young inmates. The families of French pastors
were naturally preferred; and as the pastors were in the
habit of taking French pupils also,<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> no doubt the young
English boys found suitable companions.</p>

<p>The Protestant schools,<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> established wherever possible by
the French reformers in the vicinity of their churches, were
also in favour with English parents. These schools, in which
the subjects usually taught were reading, writing, arithmetic,
and the catechism, were for obvious reasons looked on with
suspicion by the Government; one by one they were dispersed,
especially when the feeling against the Protestants
became more acute towards the middle of the seventeenth
century. Thus the schools of Rouen were closed in 1640;
and shortly afterwards Sir Ralph Verney wrote, in reply to
an inquiry about a school, that Rouen is a very unfit place,
as no Protestant masters are allowed to keep school there;
moreover, living is dear in the town, and the accent of the
inhabitants bad. In some cases, when the schools had been
closed or converted into Jesuit establishments, the ejected
schoolmasters gave private lessons, or received a few <i>pensionnaires</i>
in their homes. Even this was forbidden in 1683.
And two years later the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes
dealt the severest blow of all.</p>

<p>Regarding the Protestant Academies,<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> Sir Ralph sent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">-344-</a></span>following report to his friends in England: "There are divers
Universities at Sedan, Saumur, Geneva and other fine places,
as I am told at noe unreasonable rate, and not only Protestant
schoolmasters, but whole colleges of Protestants."<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> Many
young Englishmen were sent to one or other of these towns,
either to attend lectures at the Academies, or, more often, to
study French and the "exercises" privately, in a Protestant
atmosphere. Sir Orlando Bridgman, a friend of Sir Ralph
Verney, after letting his son study with two other English
boys under a M. Cordell at Blois, intended to send him either
to Saumur or Poitiers, then to Paris, and so to the Inns of
Court,<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> and Sir Thomas Cotton sent his sons to Saumur to
perfect themselves in French.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> In the middle of the seventeenth
century, Sir Joseph Williamson, the future statesman
and diplomat of the reign of Charles II., was living at Saumur
with several young Englishmen in his care.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> After graduating
at Oxford, he had left England in the capacity of tutor
to a young man of quality, possibly one of the sons of the
Marquis of Ormonde. At Saumur, Williamson kept a book
of notes relating to the studies of his pupils and containing
the letters which he wrote to their parents in answer to
inquiries concerning their progress. He and his pupils lived
<i>en pension</i> in a private house in the town, "with very
civil company,"&mdash;"the best way to get the language which
is much desired." On the whole Williamson's pupils do not
seem to have made as rapid progress as either he himself or
their parents desired. One anxious father writes to ask
Williamson to let his son practise writing French daily;
another exhorts his son to devote himself seriously to learning
French by reading good authors and conversing. The
Academies of Montauban and Sedan, though they never
attained a popularity equal to that of Saumur, were
not neglected, and attracted many foreign students. The
Academy at Montauban was moved to Puy Laurens in
1659, where it remained until its suppression at the
time of the Revocation. In 1678 Henry Savile, English
ambassador at Paris, informed his brother, Lord Halifax,
that there are only two Protestant Universities in France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">-345-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">TRAVELLERS AT FRENCH UNIVERSITIES</span>at Saumur and Puy Laurens, and that of these Saumur is
beyond dispute the better.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> From this we see that these
two Academies were then the best known;<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> no doubt the rest,
which had never been quite so popular, were much enfeebled by
the hostile edicts which preceded the Revocation. Lord Halifax
at first intended to send his sons to the College at Chastillon.
Savile, however, stopped them when they arrived at Paris,
as he had heard that the only teaching given at the College
was reading, writing, and the catechism&mdash;the curriculum of
the Protestant schools. In the end the boys were sent with
their governor to the Academy at Geneva. On their return
to England in 1681, one of them went to complete his education
at the University and the other to the academy which
was opened that year by the Frenchman M. Foubert, who
had set up as a teacher of the "exercises" in London.</p>

<p>Other travellers spent some time at one of the French
Universities. The University of Paris usually counted a
considerable number of English among its students, and
Clarendon tells us that those who have been there "mingle
gracefully in all companies." The Universities of Bordeaux,
Poitiers, and Montpellier were also favourite resorts. Montpellier
particularly, with its "gentle salutiferous air," attracted
those suffering from the "national complaint."<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> When Will
Allestry was there in 1668, he spent the greater part of his
time learning French, and what leisure he had he employed
in studying the Institutions.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> Orleans, famous for the
study of law, was also much patronised. The custom of
studying in French Universities, however, did not meet with
general approval in England. Sir Balthazar Gerbier pronounced
it "no less than abusing the Universities of Oxford
and Cambridge and the famous free schools of this realme
to withdraw from them the sons of Noble families and those
that are lovers of vertue." The same opinion is voiced by
Samuel Penton, Master of Exeter Hall, Oxford, who did not
omit even the Protestant Academies from his condemnation.
"The strangeness of New Faces, Language, Manners and
Studies may prove perhaps uneasie, and then their great want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">-346-</a></span>of discipline to confine him to Prayers, Exercises and Meals
is dangerous: all he will have to do is to keep in touch
with a Lecturer, and what is learned from him, most young
Gentlemen are so civil as to leave behind them when they
return."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<p>The governors who usually accompanied young travellers,
especially those of high birth, were not infrequently Frenchmen.
We are told that it was a rare sight to see a young
English nobleman at a foreign court with a governor of his
own nation,<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> though some preferred an English governor,
and cautioned travellers against foreign tutors. Samuel
Penton warns us that if the young traveller is committed, for
cheapness or curiosity, to a foreigner instead of an English
governor, "there are some in the world who without a fee
will tell you what that is like to come to."<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> One of the
English governors, J. Gailhard, who was tutor abroad to several
of the nobility and gentry, including the Earl of Huntingdon,
Lord Hastings, and Sir Thomas Grosvenor, lays down "a
method of travel" which is of special interest, as it is the
one which he followed with his own pupils.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> His view was
that, if possible, the traveller should have some knowledge
of French before setting out on his travels. The first thing he
should do on arriving at Paris is to go to the famous Protestant
temple at Charenton, and there give thanks for his safe journey
so far&mdash;whether he understand French or not. He will do
well to make but a short stay at Paris, where his progress
will be hindered by the great number of his countrymen there.
The best places to reside in are the towns along the valley of
the Loire, where there are plenty of good masters to be had.
Perhaps Angers is the best. The student is further urged to keep
a diary, and talk as much as possible&mdash;"with speaking we learn
to speak." The masters for the riding and fencing exercises,
dancing and music, are to be looked upon as so many additional
language teachers. Although "of ten words he could not
speak two right, yet let him not be ashamed and discouraged
at it: for it is not to be expected he should be a Master before
he hath been a scholar." The language master should teach
his pupil to read, write and spell correctly, and to speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">-347-</a></span>properly.
<span class="sidenote">GUIDE-BOOKS FOR TRAVELLERS</span>The material for reading must be carefully
chosen; romances, such as those of Scudéry, are often
dangerous; it is better to use books which give instruction
in such subjects as history, morality, and politics. Every
evening there should be a repetition of what has been learnt
during the day. Gailhard also draws attention to the
necessity of respecting and observing the customs of the
places visited: "Here in England, the manner is for the
master of the House to go in before a stranger, this would
pass for a great incivility in France; so here the Lady or
Mistress of the House uses to sit at the upper end of the Table,
which in France is given to Strangers. So if we be many in a
company we make no scruple to drink all out of a glass, or a
Tankard, which they are not used to do, and if a servant
would offer to give them a glass before it was washed every
time they drink, they would be angry at it. Here when a man
is sneezing we say nothing to him, but there they would look
upon't as a want of civility. Again, we in England upon a
journey, use to ask one another how we do, but in France
they do no such thing&mdash;amongst them that question would
answer to this, 'what aileth you that you look so ill?'"</p>

<p>The attitude of the French teachers in England towards
the foreign tour gradually changed. They no longer saw in
it a rival institution, depriving them of many of their pupils,
but, on the contrary, a means of giving the finishing touch to
the results of their own efforts in England. All strongly advise
their pupils to go to France, and most of them add directions
for travel in their text-books.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> Mauger's dialogues include
"most exact instructions for travel, very useful and necessary
for all gentlemen that intend to travel into France," and
Lainé's grammar is "enriched with choice dialogues useful
for persons of quality that intend to travel into France, leading
them as by the hand to the most noted and principal places
of the kingdom."</p>

<p>As the tour in France increased in popularity, the directions
furnished by French teachers were supplemented by guide-books
properly so called; towards the end of the seventeenth
century books such as <i>The Present State of France</i>
and <i>The Description of Paris</i> were to be had at every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">-348-</a></span>bookseller's in London.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> As early as 1604 Sir Robert Dallington
had written his <i>View of France</i>, in which he refers
to a book called the <i>French Guide</i>, which "undertaketh to
resemble eche countrie to some other thing, as Bretaigne to
a horse-shoe, Picardy to a Neat's toung etc., which are but
idle and disproportioned comparisons." Peter Heylyn, chaplain
at the Courts of Charles I. and Charles II., was the author
of two popular books of this type: <i>France painted to the Life
by a learned and impartial Hand</i>,<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> and <i>A Full relation of two
Journeys, the one in the mainland of France, the other in some
of the adjacent Islands</i>.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> Some of these guides are descriptions
of the country, others are relations of journeys made there;
to the first category belongs <i>A Description of France in its
several governments by J. S. Gent</i> (1692), and to the second, <i>A
Journey to Paris in the year 1698 by Dr. Martin Lister</i>. Some
include advice as to the course of study to be followed. And
as Italy was still frequently included in the tour, travellers were
sometimes supplied with information regarding that country.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<p>So popular did the tour in France become in the seventeenth
century that guide-books for travellers were produced on the
spot. The earliest French books of this kind had not been
specially designed for the use of foreign visitors; they were
as a rule descriptions of the towns and their geographical
positions, or notices on their history and antiquities.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> In
time, however, they assumed a character more particularly
adapted to strangers.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> One of the best known and most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">-349-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">ROUTES USUALLY FOLLOWED</span>popular was <i>Le Voyage de France, dressé pour l'instruction et
commodité tant des Français que des étrangers</i>, first published
in 1639. The author, C. de Varennes, gives directions for
the study of French. He thinks Oudin's Grammar the most
profitable, on account of the manner in which it deals with
the chief difficulties of foreigners, and Paris and Orleans the
best towns for study. For the rest, the help of a tutor should
be enlisted, and the student should converse as much as
possible with children, and with persons of learning and
ability; he should also read widely, preferably dialogues in
familiar style and the latest novels; and write French, for
which exercise he will find much help in the <i>Secrétaire de
la Cour</i> and the <i>Secrétaire à la mode</i>,<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> collections of letters and
"compliments," which, we may say incidentally, enjoyed a
popularity greatly exceeding their merit.</p>

<p>The short tour in France grew in popularity as the seventeenth
century advanced, and many were content to spend the
whole of their sojourn abroad there, without undertaking the
longer continental tour. Others went to France to prepare themselves
for the longer tour. Naturally the tour in France alone
engaged the attention of French teachers. We are told that
the cost of a tour of three months need not be more than £50.
"If you take a friend with you 'twill make you miss a thousand
opportunities of following your end: you go to get French,
and it would be best if you could avoid making an acquaintance
with any Englishman there. To converse with their
learned men will be beside your purpose too, if you go for
so short a time: they talk the worst for conversation and
you had rather be with the ladies."<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<p>The chief routes which French masters in England advised
their pupils to take were those from Dover to Boulogne and
from Rye to Dieppe, whence it was usual to proceed through
Rouen to Paris.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> Locke, for instance, landed at Boulogne
when on his way to the South of France; thence he made his
way to Paris, chiefly on foot.<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> "If Paris be heaven (for the
French with their usual justice, extol it above all things on
earth)," he writes after a night spent at Poy, "Poy certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">-350-</a></span>is purgatory on the way to it." His impressions of Tilliard
were more favourable: "Good mutton, and a good supper,
clean linen of the country, and a pretty girl to lay it (who
was an angel compared with the fiends of Poy) made us some
amends for the past night's suffering." It was on the same
route to Paris that the Norman Claude du Val, afterwards
notorious on the English highways, first came into contact
with the English as he was journeying to Paris to try his
fortune there. At Rouen he met a band of young Englishmen
on their way to Paris with their governors, to learn the
exercises and to "fit themselves to go a-wooing at their return
home; who were infinitely ambitious of his company, not
doubting but in those two days' travel (from Rouen to Paris)
they should pump many considerable things out of him,
both as to the language and customs of France: and upon
that account they did willingly defray his charges." When
the young Englishmen arrived at Paris and settled in the
usual quarter, the Faubourg St. Germain, Du Val attached
himself to their service, and betook himself to England on
the Restoration, which drained Paris of many of its English
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></p>

<p>Many travellers, however, agreed with the French teachers
that Paris was not a suitable place for serious study of French,
both on account of the many distractions it offered and of
the great number of English people resident there. It therefore
became customary with the more serious-minded to
retire for a time to some quiet provincial town where the
accent was good. The French teacher Wodroeph tells us
as much: "Mais, Monsieur, je vois bien que vous estes
estranger et vous allez à la cour à Paris pour y apprendre
nostre langue françoise. Mais mieux il vous vaut d'aller à
Orleans plustost que d'y aller pour hanter la cour et baiser
les Dames et Damoiselles. . . . Parquoy je vous conseille
mieux vous en esloigner et d'aller à Orleans là où vous apprendrez
la vraye methode de la langue vulgaire."<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> The
towns in the valley of the Loire were favourite resorts for
purposes of study.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> Orleans, Blois, and Saumur seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">-351-</a></span>have been the most popular. <span class="sidenote">LOIRE TOWNS FAVOURED</span>For instance, James Howell,
after spending some time in Paris, where he lodged near the
Bastille&mdash;"the part furthest off from the quarters where the
English resort," for he wished "to go on to get a little language"<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>
as soon as he could&mdash;went to Orleans to study
French; he describes it as "the most charming town on
the Loire, and the best to learn the language in the purity."
The town was never without a great abundance of strangers.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>
The fame of Blois and its teachers was widespread; and
Bourges, Tours, Angers, and Caen were noted for the purity
of their French. Saumur and other towns in which the
Protestants were powerful were also much frequented. John
Malpet, afterwards Principal of Gloucester Hall, Oxford,
spent two years in France with his pupil, Lord Falkland,
visiting Orleans, Blois, and Saumur.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> John Evelyn visited
Paris, Blois, Orleans, and Lyons, and finally settled at Tours,
where he engaged a French master and studied the language
diligently for nineteen weeks.</p>

<p>While studying in one or other of these towns, English
travellers usually lodged in hotels, <i>auberges</i>, or <i>pensions</i>,<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>
and sometimes with French families. One of their chief
difficulties appears to have been to avoid their fellow-countrymen
in such places. Gabriel Du Grès suggests
that when English students are thus thrown together they
should come to an agreement that any one who spoke
his native tongue should pay a fine. A further though
less serious impediment was the speaking of Latin, still
considered necessary to the traveller by scholars such as
John Brinsley.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> For this reason travellers "for language"
are advised to frequent the company of women and children,
and "polite" society, rather than that of scholars. It is a
great inconvenience, observes Du Grès, if your landlord can
speak Latin. The majority of travellers, however, do not
appear to have experienced any embarrassment in this respect;
on the contrary, those with little previous knowledge
of French found their Latin of use in their first French lessons
if they studied the language "grammatically" with a master.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">-352-</a></span>French teachers in England usually recommended suitable
<i>pensions</i> to their students. Gabriel Du Grès, for instance, gives
a list of such lodgings at Saumur, his native town; Mauger,
of those of Blois, Orleans, and other towns in the Loire valley.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
In like manner they addressed their pupils to recommendable
academies for instruction in the polite accomplishments and
military exercises. However, for the most part they advised
their pupils to go to private masters, who would attend to
their French as well as the "exercises." The house of M.
Doux, who had a riding school at Blois, was considered a
particularly appropriate residence for those desiring to learn
French, on account of his daughters, who spoke "wondrously
well," as was also that of a certain M. Dechaussé, who kept
an academy for teaching young gentlemen to ride.</p>

<p>What is more, French teachers in England, no longer
regarding their fellow-workers in France as rivals but rather
as collaborators, as we have seen, not infrequently entertained
friendly relations with them, and even went so far as
to direct pupils to them. Claude Mauger, for instance, sent
as many of his pupils as possible to M. Gaudrey at Paris, the
author of verses in praise of Mauger's <i>Tableau du Jugement
Universel</i>. This change of attitude is probably explained by
the fact that in the seventeenth century French was studied
more seriously in England than in the sixteenth century; and
students on their arrival in France had often had preliminary
instruction under the care of a French tutor in England;
Clarendon significantly states that in France "we quickly
<i>renew</i> the acquaintance we have had with the language by
the practice and custom of speaking it." Students going
abroad for purposes of study are therefore addressed to M.
Nicolas, an excellent master at Paris, M. le Fèvre, an <i>avocat
en parlement</i> at Orleans, and others. We are also informed
that <i>abbés</i> were fond of teaching their language to strangers,
especially the English.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> Moreover, several French teachers in
England had previously exercised their profession in France.
The most popular of all, Claude Mauger, had spent seven years
teaching French at Blois. Many years later, when he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">-353-</a></span><span class="sidenote">FRENCH GRAMMARS FOR TRAVELLERS</span>made his reputation as a successful teacher of French in
London, he went for a time to Paris, where he settled in the
Faubourg St. Germain, and was busily occupied in teaching
French to travellers, among others to the Earl of Salisbury.
He also tells us that his books were very popular in France,
and used by the great majority of English students there.</p>

<p>Several of the French teachers in France wrote books for
the use of their pupils. Mauger himself quotes the authority
of "all French Grammarians that are Professors in France
for the teaching of travellers the language." Yet in the
seventeenth century, when the French language became one
of the chief preoccupations of polite society as well as of
scholars, many grammars paid no attention to teaching the
language to foreigners. There were, however, several well-known
teachers of languages at Paris who wrote grammars
specially for their use. Alcide de St. Maurice, the author
of the <i>Guide fidelle des estrangers dans le voyage de France</i>
(1672), composed a grammar called <i>Remarques sur les principales
difficultez de la langue françoise</i> (1674), which has little
value, and is compiled chiefly from Vaugelas and Ménage. His
chief aim was to overcome the usual difficulties&mdash;pronunciation
and orthography. Several years previously he had written a
collection of short stories inspired by the <i>Decameron</i>. The
<i>Fleurs, Fleurettes et passetemps ou les divers caractères de l'amour
honneste</i>, as he called them, were published at Paris in 1666,
and were no doubt intended as reading matter for his pupils.</p>

<p>A work called the <i>Nova Grammatica Gallica</i>, written in
Latin and French for the use of foreigners, appeared at Paris
in 1678. It is mainly compiled from Chiflet and other
French grammarians. A certain M. Mauconduy was responsible
for the grammar, which was on much the same lines as
that of Maupas. The French theologian M. de Saint-Amour,
of the Sorbonne, addressed several foreigners to Mauconduy,
who issued for their use daily <i>feuillets volants</i>, containing remarks
on the language. His pupils made rapid progress, and
usually knew French fairly well in three months, we are told.</p>

<p>Another of these teachers, Denys Vairasse d'Allais,<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> lived,
like Mauger, in the Faubourg St. Germain, and like him
taught English as well as French. He had spent some
time in England in his youth, and perhaps taught French
there. He also corresponded with Pepys, the famous diarist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">-354-</a></span>Vairasse had a particular affection for his English pupils, and
they appear to have been in the majority. He was a strong
advocate of the study of grammar, and condemned attempts
to learn French "by imitation" alone. His <i>Grammaire
Méthodique contenant en abrégé les principes de cet art et les
regles les plus necessaires de la langue françoise dans un ordre
claire et naturelle</i> appeared at Paris in 1682.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> In it he criticizes
severely all the French grammars for the use of strangers
produced either in France or in foreign countries. Shortly
afterwards the grammar was abridged and translated into
English as <i>A Short and Methodical Introduction to the French
Tongue composed for the particular benefit of the English</i>,
printed at Paris in 1683. This French grammar published
in English at Paris is a striking testimony to the importance
of the English as students of French.</p>

<p>René Milleran, like Vairasse d'Allais, taught English as
well as French. He was a native of Saumur, but spent most
of his life at Paris teaching languages, and for a time acted
as interpreter to the king. He composed for the use of his
pupils a French grammar entitled <i>La Nouvelle Grammaire
Françoise, avec le Latin à coté des exemples devisée en deux
parties</i> (Marseilles, 1692), which is no doubt a first edition of
his <i>Les deux Gramaires Fransaizes</i> (Marseilles, 1694), in
which he expounds his new system of orthography. His
collection of letters, <i>Lettres Familieres Galantes et autres sur
toutes sortes de sujets, avec leurs responses</i>, of which the third
edition appeared in 1700, enjoyed a great popularity, like
most similar collections at this time: successive editions
appeared right into the eighteenth century. This, he says,
was the first work which won for him the favour of so many
foreign noblemen. His method was to give the students
copies of the letters in either Latin or their own language,
and to let them translate them into French. He announced
an edition of the letters with English, German, and Latin
translations for the use of his pupils, but it does not appear to
have been published. Like most writers connected with the
Court, Milleran calls attention to the purity of his style, and
announces that no other books give such exact rules for the
language of the Court. A special feature of his work was
the selection of letters by members of the French Academy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">-355-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">HOWELL'S ADVICE TO TRAVELLERS</span>Nor was the more familiar side neglected: there are numerous
letters to and from students of French, reporting on their progress
in the language, with mutual congratulations on improvement
in style, etc. It is said of Milleran's compositions
that their chief merit is their scarcity, and few will agree
with De Linière, the satirist and enemy of Boileau, who wrote
in praise of Milleran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Not a few English travellers dispensed with the services
of a tutor in France. Among these was James Howell, who
studied French at Paris, Orleans, and Poissy, where he endangered
his health by too close application; he acted for a
time as travelling tutor to the son of Baron Altham. He
put his knowledge of French to the test by translating his own
first literary production, <i>Dodona's Grove</i>. This, he says, he
submitted to the new <i>Académie des beaux esprits</i>, founded by
Richelieu, which gave it a public expression of approbation.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>
The translation was printed at Paris in 1641 under the title
of <i>Dendrologie ou la Forêt de Dodone</i>. Howell left instructions
for travellers, based on his own experience of study abroad,
and typical of the theories current at the time. He advises<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>
the student who has settled in some quiet town to choose a
room looking on to the street, "to take in the common cry
and language"; to keep a diary during the day, and in the
evening to write an essay from this material, "for the penne
maketh the deepest furrowes, and doth fertilize and enrich
the memory more than anything else." He should avoid the
company of his countrymen, "the greatest bane of English
Gentlemen abroad," and frequent cafés and ordinaries,<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> and
engage a French page-boy "to parley and chide withal,
whereof he shall have occasion enough."<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> Howell strongly
felt the necessity of travelling in France at an early age in
order to gain a good pronunciation, "hardly overcome by one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">-356-</a></span>who has past the minority ... the French tongue by reason
of the huge difference betwixt their writing and speaking
will put one often into fits of despair and passion." He
draws a grotesque picture of "some of the riper plants" who
"overact themselves, for while they labour to <i>trencher le mot</i>,
to cut the word as they say, and speake like naturall Frenchmen,
and to get the true genuine tone ... they fall a lisping
and mincing, and so distort and strain their mouths and voyce
so that they render themselves fantastique and ridiculous:
let it be sufficient for one of riper years to speak French
intelligibly, roundly, and congruously, without such forced
affectation." It is equally important to avoid bashfulness
in speaking: "whatsoever it is, let it come forth confidently
whether true or false sintaxis; for a bold vivacious spirit
hath a very great advantage in attaining the French, or
indeed any other language."</p>

<p>The student will also do well to repair sometimes "to the
Courts of pleading and to the Publique Schools. For in
France they presently fall from the Latine to dispute in the
vulgar tongue." He should also combine the study of
grammar&mdash;that of Maupas is the best&mdash;with his practical
exercises, and begin a course of reading, making notes as he
goes on. The most suitable books are those dealing with
the history of France, such as Serres and D'Aubigné. Much
judgment is needed in the choice of books on other subjects,
"especially when there is such a confusion of them as in
France, which, as Africk, produceth always something new,
for I never knew week pass in Paris, but it brought forth
some new kinds of authors: but let him take heed of tumultuary
and disjointed Authors, as well as of the frivolous and
pedantique." However, "there be some French poets will
affoord excellent entertainment specially Du Bartas, and
'twere not amisse to give a slight salute to Ronsard and
Desportes, and the late Théophile.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> And touching poets,
they must be used like flowers, some must only be smelt into,
but some are good to be thrown into a limbique to be Distilled."</p>

<p>The student is likewise admonished to make a collection
of French proverbs, and translate from English into French&mdash;the
most difficult task in learning the language, "for to translate
another tongue into English is not hard or profitable."
Finally, "for Sundayes and Holydayes, there bee many

many fine pieces to this purpose, du Plessis, Allencour and
others. And let him be conversant with such bookes only
on Sundayes and not mingle humane studies with them.
His closet must be his Rendez-vous whensoever hee is surprized
with any fit of perverseness, as thoughts of Country
or Kindred will often affect one."</p>

<p>Having acquired some knowledge of French in this retirement,
"hee may then adventure upon Paris, and the Court,
and visit Ambassadours," and go in the train of some young
nobleman. In addition he should enter into the life of the
town, read the weekly gazettes and newspapers, "and it were
not amisse for him to spend some time in the New Academy,
erected lately by the French Cardinall Richelieu, where all
the sciences are read in the French tongue which is done of
purpose to refine and enrich the Language." He may also
frequent one of the divers Academies in Paris, for private
gentlemen and cadets.</p>

<p>It was also customary to make either the <i>Grand</i> or the
<i>Petit Tour</i> of France, after the period of studious retirement.
The <i>Grand Tour</i> included Lyons, Marseilles, Toulouse, Bordeaux,
and Paris; the <i>Petit Tour</i>, Paris, Tours, and Poitiers.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>
Paris, we can guess, was the chief attraction to most young
Englishmen of family and fortune. Dryden thus describes
the education of a young gentleman of fashion:<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> "Your
father sent you into France at twelve years old, bred you up
at Paris, first at a college and then at an Academy." Much
importance was attached to a course of study at the University
there, and many recognized the advantages gained therefrom.
But on the other hand there were not a few complaints of the
dangers of lack of discipline and the company of dissolute
scholars, and still more, of the neglect of all serious study.
Clarendon<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> assures us that many English travellers never
saw the University nor knew in what part of Paris it stood;
but "dedicate all that precious season only to Dancing and
other exercises, which is horribly to misspend it"; with the
result that when such a traveller returns to England, all his
learning consists in wearing his clothes well, and he has at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">-358-</a></span>least one French fellow to wait upon him and comb his periwig.
He is a "most accomplish'd Harlequin:"<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Drest in a tawdrey suit, at Paris made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which he more than twice the value paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">French his attendants, French alone his mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can speak, his native language is uncouth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If to the ladies he doth make advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His very looks must have the air of France.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Such being the case, Admiral Penn thought well to send his
son William to France<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> in the hope that the brilliant life
there would make him forget the Quaker sympathies formed
at Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> The plan succeeded for the time being; Penn
returned "a most modish person, a fine Gentleman, with all
the latest French fashions," and Pepys<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> reports that he perceived
"something of learning he hath got, but a great deale,
if not too much of the vanity of the French garbe and affected
manner of speech and gait. I fear all real profit he hath
made of his travel will signify little."</p>

<p>No doubt many "raw young travellers" did "waste their
time abroad in gallantry, ignorant for the most part of foreign
languages, and no recommendation to their own country."<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>
Costeker in <i>The Compleat Education of a Young Nobleman</i>
pictures what the young traveller abroad often is, and what
he might be. To begin with, "the utmost of his thoughts
and ideas are confined to the more fashionable part of dress."
Then, "according to custom, our Beau is designed to Travel;
the Tour proposed is to France, Italy and Spain. Were I
to act the part of an impartial Inquisitor I would ask for
what? Why, most undoubtedly, I might expect to be
answered, to see the World again and perfect his Studies, and
by that means compleat the fine Gentleman. Thus equiped
with a fine Estate, little Learning, and less Sense, and
intirely ignorant of all Languages but his own, he launches
into a foreign Nation, without the least knowledge of his own,
where the sharpers will find him out, discover his Intellects,
and make the most of him; they besiege him with fulsome
Adulation, against which his feminine refined Understanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">-359-</a></span>is too weak to resist.
<span class="sidenote">SIR JOHN RERESBY IN FRANCE</span>I will not dwell long upon the subject
of his stay there, supposing he has made his Tour, and seen
all the most remarkable and wondrous curiosities of those
Nations, he returns a little better than he went, except for
smattering a little of the tongues, and can give us but as bad
and imperfect an Account of their nation as he was capable
of giving them of ours; all the Advantage he brings from
thence is their Modes and Vices ... the incommoding a
French Peruke unmans the Bow at once."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> And next to
himself he "loves best anyone who will call him a <i>Bel Esprit</i>."
How different a picture from that of the traveller which is
painted as a model to young Englishmen: at the age of
twenty he goes abroad for two years, after having acquired
a true knowledge of his own nation and made himself master
of French and Latin. He is capable of learning more in a
month than another ignorant of languages can in twelve.
"I am confident were all our young Noblemen educated in
this manner the French Court would no longer bee esteem'd
the Residence of Politeness and Belles Lettres but must then
yield to the British one in many degrees, by reason our young
Gentlemen would not only be perfect Masters in their exterior
but intellectual Perfections, and England will then be fam'd
for the Excellency of Manners and Politeness as it is now for
the incomparable Beauty of the Ladies."<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p>Sir John Reresby's account of how he spent his time
abroad may be given as a fairly typical example.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> He went
to France, in company with Mr. Leech, his governor, in 1654.
They travelled from Rye to Dieppe, and thence to Paris,
passing through Rouen. Their stay at Paris was very short,
as Reresby found the great resort of his countrymen there a
great "prevention" to learning the language. "I stayed no
longer in Paris," he tells us, "than to get my clothes, and to
receive my bills of exchange, and so went to live in a pension
or boarding house at Blois.... I employed my time here
in learning the language, the guitar and dancing, till July,
and then, there having been some likelihood of a quarrel
between me and a Dutch gentleman in the same house, my
governour prevailed with me to go and live at Saumur<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">-360-</a></span>At Saumur in addition to the exercises I learnt at Blois, I
learned to fence, and to play of the lute. Besides that I
studied philosophy and the mathematicks, with my governor,
who read lectures of each to me every other day. After eight
months' stay I had got so much of the language to be able to
converse with some ladies of the town, especially the daughters
of one M. du Plessis.... In the month of April I began to
make the little tour or circuit of France, and returned to
Saumur after some six weeks' absence. In July, I went
(desirous to avoid much English company resident at Saumur)
to Le Mans, the capital town of Mayence, with the two Mr.
Leeches and one Mr. Butler. We lodged, and were in pension
at the parson's or minister's house; there were there no
strangers. There were several French persons of quality
that lived there at that time, as the Marquis de Cogne's widow,
the Marquis de Verdun, and several others, who made us
partakers of the pastimes and diversions of the place. All
that winter few weeks did pass, that there were not balls
three times at the least, and we had the freer access by reason
that the women were more numerous than the men. I
stayed there till April 1656, and then returned to Saumur
with my Governor alone." After staying there for some time,
Reresby dismissed his governor and made a tour in Italy.</p>

<h3>GALLOMANIA AFTER THE RESTORATION</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> French teachers of London at the time of the Restoration,
chief amongst whom were Claude Mauger, Paul Festeau,
Pierre Lainé, and Guillaume Herbert, all urged students to
travel in France as a means of completing the knowledge of
French acquired in England; yet at the same time they
naturally and in their own interests lay emphasis on the
facilities for learning the language in England, especially
after the Restoration, when, to use Mauger's words, there
was a little France in London, as well as a little England in
Paris; "there being so great a correspondence between the
two Courts of England and France that we see here continually
the Lords of the latter, as they see at Paris persons of quality
of the former, besides an infinity of others going and coming
from thence." This indeed was the period in which Francomania
reached its height in England. During the Commonwealth
the English Court and many of the nobility and gentry
had sojourned in France, and returned thence imbued with
admiration for everything French. This admiration was
intensified by the universal popularity of the French language
and French fashions. Gentlemen from all parts of Europe
repaired to France to learn the language and "frenchify" their
manners. France was the country to which English gentlemen
resorted "to get their breeding"; and the Chancellor
Clarendon held that their manners were much improved by
the contact. On the other hand, French men and women of
the same class came to the English Court in larger numbers
than ever before. Some returned with their English friends
at the Restoration. Others followed later, for the English
Court offered more attractions to pleasure-seekers than did
the French Court, now under the influence of Madame de
Maintenon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">-362-</a></span>The indignation and dismay aroused in France by the
execution of Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> made the welcome offered to the
royalist emigrants all the warmer in the first instance. We
are told that Paris, and indeed all France, was full of loyal
fugitives.<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> The exiled English Court was sheltered at the
Louvre and the Palais Royal in turn.<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> The queen arrived
in her native land in 1644, and shortly afterwards came Prince
Charles, then about sixteen years old, and James, the young
Duke of York. Mlle. de Montpensier, the grand-daughter
of Henry IV., remarks on the French of the two young
princes. James, she thought, spoke the language with ease,
and very well indeed, and Mademoiselle was no lenient critic.<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>
But Charles had not drawn as much profit from the lessons
received in England.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> He found the pronunciation an almost
insuperable difficulty, stammered and hesitated, and during
the early part of his stay remained almost mute for want of
words. Mademoiselle says he could not utter one intelligible
sentence in French, though he understood all she said to him.
Charles, however, soon felt the benefit of his sojourn abroad.
When he returned to France from Holland in 1648, he had
already made much progress and answered the French king
readily in French, when that monarch inquired about the
horses and dogs of the Prince of Orange. He was ready
enough to talk of hunting in French, but when the queen
wished to know about the progress of his affairs, and to talk
of serious matters, he excused himself, declaring he could not
speak French.<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> He would also sit silent for long periods in
Mlle. de Montpensier's presence, and only ventured to convey
his compliments to her through Lord Jermyn, one of the chief
counsellors of Charles I., who remained in the service of the
queen during her exile in France. But the princess was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">-363-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">THE ENGLISH COURT IN FRANCE</span>delighted to see a great improvement in his speaking of the
language at the time of his return from the expedition into
Scotland, and the fatal battle of Worcester. He forgot his
shyness and spoke French well, relating to her the thrilling
story of his escape, and how he was "furieusement ennuyé"
in Scotland, where they think it a sin to listen to a violin.
He was also able to make the princess very pretty compliments
in French, and on these occasions, she remarks, he spoke
the language particularly well.<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>Charles is even said to have gone incognito to several
French reformed churches during his stay in France. The
presence of Cromwell's ambassador prevented his going to
the famous church of Charenton, but he went to others.
On one occasion he listened to the sermon in the Protestant
church of La Rochelle, in company with the Duke of Ormond,
and expressed his satisfaction to one or two of the congregation
to whom he revealed his identity.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p>Many other Englishmen improved their French during their
enforced stay on the Continent. Most of the high officials
of the Court of Charles I., the courtiers, nobles, and gentlemen
round the king, spent the greater part of the interregnum
in Paris, although some of them were disturbed by the
French understanding with Cromwell in 1656. John Evelyn<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>
enumerates most of the distinguished Englishmen he met in
France,<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> and remarks on the number of French courtiers
who paid their respects to the king (Charles II.); he himself
kissed His Majesty's hand at St. Germain's. French courtiers
had free intercourse with the English at concerts, festivals,
and other entertainments.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> They also met at the Academies so
fashionable at the time. On the 13th March 1650, for instance,
Evelyn witnessed a "triumph" in Mr. Del Campo's Academy,
where "divers of the French and English noblesse, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">-364-</a></span>my Lord of Ossory, and Richard, sons to the Marquis of
Ormond (afterwards Duke), did their exercises on horseback
in noble equipage before a world of spectators and great
persons, men and ladies." And again, on the 24th of May,
he writes, "we were invited by the Noble Academies to
a running, where were many brave horses, gallants and
ladies, my Lord Stanhope entertaining us with a collation."
The king's brother, the young Duke of Gloucester, set the
example by daily attending one of these academies. Sir
John Reresby, that time-serving politician, has also left an
account of his journey in France during the Commonwealth.
On his arrival at Paris in 1654 he saw the king, the Duke
of York, and Prince Rupert playing at billiards in the Palais
Royal; "but was incognito, it being crime sufficient the
waiting upon His Majesty to have caused the sequestration
of his estates."<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> Reresby was again in France in 1659, and
was well received by Henrietta Maria. Almost alone of the
English exiles, Sir Edward Hyde, the Chancellor, who found
the discomforts of the exiled Court very great, failed to become
a fluent speaker of French, chiefly because he was unable to
overcome the difficulties of the pronunciation. After the
Restoration he was the one high official of the English Court
who did not speak the language with fluency. It was not
till the time of his exile in France, after his disgrace in
1668, that he mastered the language sufficiently to read its
literature; but he still found "many inconveniences" in
speaking it.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a></p>

<p>Men of letters formed a considerable section of the English
colony in France. Waller, Denham, Cowley, Davenant,
Hobbes, Killigrew, Shirley, Fanshawe, Crashaw, etc., and later
Roscommon, Rochester, Buckingham, Wycherley, Vanbrugh,
and others lived in France, and some mixed freely in French
literary circles, then centring round the Hôtel de Rambouillet,
and such names as those of Malherbe, Vaugelas, Corneille,
Bossuet, Scudéry, La Calprenède. English literature of the
Restoration gives ample proof of their familiarity with both
the language and literature of their hosts.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> Waller, for instance,
after spending some time at Rouen, moved to Paris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">-365-</a></span>where he lived "in great splendour and hospitality."<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>
<span class="sidenote">ENGLISH MEN OF LETTERS IN FRANCE</span>Cowley,
who had followed the queen to Paris, became secretary to
Lord Jermyn, afterwards Earl of St. Albans, and deciphered
the letters which passed between the king and queen of
England. The dramatist Davenant was twice in France,
where he remained several years on his second visit. Hobbes,
who for many years acted as a travelling tutor, made his
mark in the philosophic circles of Paris, and knew Mersenne,
Sorbière, and Gassendi. He fled to Paris during the civil
wars, and for a time was engaged in teaching arithmetic to
the Prince of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p>Among the many children sent to France for education
during the Civil War and Commonwealth were several future
literary men. Both Vanbrugh and Wycherley were brought
up in this way. At the age of fifteen Wycherley was "sent
for education to the Western parts of France, either to Saintonges
or the Angoumois. His abode there was either upon
the Banks of the Charente, or very little remov'd from it.
And he had there the Happiness to be in the neighbourhood
of one of the most accomplish'd Ladies of the Court of France,
Mme. de Montausier, whom Voiture has made famous by
several very ingenious letters, the most of which were writ
to her when she was a Maid, and call'd Mlle. de Rambouillet.
I have heard Mr. Wycherley say he was often admitted to
the Conversation of that lady, who us'd to call him the Little
Hugenot: and that young as he was, he was equally pleased with
the Beauty of her Mind, and with the Graces of her person."<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<p>One of the young royalists who received his education in
France during the Commonwealth so completely mastered
the French language that he gained an important place among
French men of letters: the famous Anthony Hamilton, the
author of short stories in French<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>&mdash;masterpieces in the light
vein<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>&mdash;and of the well-known life of his gallant brother-in-law,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">-366-</a></span>the Comte de Grammont, which gives a vivid picture of the
life at the Court of Charles II. Hamilton has been placed
second only to Voltaire as a representative of the <i>esprit
français</i>.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

<p>At the Restoration, Hamilton returned to England with
the rest of the English emigrants, together with a considerable
number of Frenchmen who had attached themselves to the
English Court. He was followed two years later by the hero
of his <i>Mémoires</i>,<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> the Comte de Grammont, who pronounced
the English Court so like that of France in manners and
conversation that he could hardly realize he was in another
country.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> French was the language freely used by the
English emigrants on their return to London, and by others
in imitation of them. "French is the most in use," wrote
William Higford in the year of the Restoration, "a most
sweet tongue called the Woman's tongue, and as I think for
the address from the servant to the mistress, and from the
servant to the soveraigne, there is no sweeter nor more civil."<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
The use of the French language was spreading all over Europe,
but nowhere was it so popular as in England: "indeed it is
most alamode and best pleases the ladies and we cannot
deny but Messieurs of France are excellent wits."<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<p>The presence of so many of these <i>messieurs</i> in London
intensified the already strong French atmosphere. Several
famous names occur in the list of French ladies and gentlemen
who took up their abode in England at this time. Shortly
before De Grammont, St. Evremond had arrived in England,
where he spent over thirty years, and died in 1703. Both
played important parts in the social life of the time. De
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">-367-</a></span>Grammont especially was very popular.
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH COURTIERS IN LONDON</span>He received a warm
welcome at Court, where he met many old friends and was
overwhelmed with hospitality; to make an engagement with
him it was necessary to see him a fortnight beforehand.
He himself added to the Court festivities by giving French
entertainments in the Parisian style.</p>

<p>At the numerous festivities held in honour of De Grammont,
St. Evremond<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> was almost invariably one of the guests. He
soon became the centre of a <i>coterie</i>, half English and half
French, including his literary companion the Dutchman
Vossius, Canon of Windsor, the French doctor Le Fèvre, professor
of chemistry to Charles II.,<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> and the learned Huguenot
Henri Justel, who had charge of the royal library at St. James's.
What contributed most to reconcile St. Evremond to his life
in England, however, was the arrival of Hortense Mancini,
Duchesse de Mazarin, niece of the cardinal. The French
ambassador Courtin said England was the refuge of French
wives who had quarrelled with their husbands, and the
Duchesse was one of these.<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> In her <i>salon</i> St. Evremond met
the most distinguished Englishmen and foreign ministers of
the day. He saw her daily, and she inspired much of his
best work. There, too, met French Catholics, Huguenots,
and Englishmen, free from all religious prejudice, and
talked of the subjects which interested them most. Another
of Mazarin's nieces, the Duchesse de Bouillon,<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> was
also in London for a time, and received in her <i>salon</i> Waller,
St. Evremond, and others; at one time there was a possibility
of La Fontaine joining her circle. La Fontaine seems to have
felt some interest in England and the English, who, he says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="fr"><span class="i8">pensent profondément;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leur esprit, en cela, suit leur tempérament,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ils étendent partout l'empire des sciences.<br /></span></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">To Mrs. Harvey, sister of Lord Montagu and friend of the
Duchess of Mazarin, he dedicated his fable <i>Le Renard Anglais</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">-368-</a></span>Both St. Evremond and the Duchess of Mazarin ended
their days in England.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> St. Evremond enjoyed the favour of
three English kings. Charles II. gave him a pension, and
when William III. dined with one of his courtiers, he is said
to have always stipulated that the French writer should be of
the party, as he took great delight in his conversation. Though
St. Evremond received permission in 1689 to return to his
native land, he did not avail himself of the offer, preferring
to remain in the midst of his English friends, who were accustomed
to his ways and manners and his peculiarities.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> But
during the whole of his thirty years' stay in England he made
no attempt to speak English. French was the language in
which he and the rest of his countrymen carried on their daily
intercourse with their hosts.</p>

<p>Pepys also refers frequently to the Frenchmen he met in
London.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> On one occasion at the Cockpit his attention was
diverted from the stage by a group of loquacious Frenchmen
in a box, who, not understanding English, were amusing
themselves by asking a pretty lady, who knew both languages,
what the actors said. "Lord! what sport they
made!" says Pepys. On another occasion at Whitehall he
met a very communicative Frenchman with one eye, who
shared a coach with him, and told him the history of his own
life "without asking."</p>

<p>Covent Garden, we are told, was the favourite resort of
the French residents, "nearer the Court, than the Exchange."<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>
Their presence, however, was not confined to Court circles;
for the French were beginning to take an interest in England
and to visit the country,<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> although, as yet, their curiosity had
not extended to the language. In a few cases English
was studied. Mauger even tells us that several of his contemporaries
learnt it in France. It is certain that some
employed the services of the French teachers of London,
who were willing to teach their newly acquired language to
their countrymen; for this purpose the practice of attaching
English grammars to French ones&mdash;a combination first
instituted by Mauger, who urged the French and English to

<span class="sidenote">FRENCH VALETS AND "FEMMES DE CHAMBRE"</span>avail themselves of this opportunity of exchanging lessons&mdash;became
more and more common as the seventeenth century
drew to its close. In the meanwhile guide-books<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> and relations
of travel in England appeared. The writer of one of
these, M. Payen,<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> remarks on the great number of strangers,
especially Frenchmen, in London.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> At the time of the
Restoration, however, the chief significance of their presence
lies in the need they created for the English to speak French.</p>

<p>The great demand for everything French, including the
language, offered an opening for many Frenchmen in London;
for all the men and women of fashion were not in the position
of De Grammont, who sent his valet, Thermes, to France every
week to bring back the latest fashions from Paris. "Nothing
will go down with the town now," writes a contemporary
author, "but French fashions, French dancing, French songs,
French servants, French wines, French kickshaws, and now
and then French sawce come in among them, and so no
doubt but French doctors may be in esteem too."<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> In
almost every book written at the time there is some reference
to the mania for French fashions. And some time later the
Abbé Le Blanc relates how, on one occasion in England, a self-satisfied
Englishman taunted him thus: "Il faut que votre
pays soit bien pauvre, puisque tant de gens sont obligés de le
quitter pour chercher à vivre en celui-ci. C'est vous qui nous
fournissez de Maîtres à danser, de Perruquiers, de Tailleurs,
et de Valets de chambre: et nous vous devons cette justice,
pour la Frisure ou pour le Menuet, les François l'emportent
sur toutes les autres Nations. Je ne comprens pas comment
on aime si fort la Danse dans un Pays où l'on a si peu sujet

Vignes que pour nous?"<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

<p>Regarding the French <i>valets</i> and <i>femmes de chambre</i> in
London, the Abbé writes: "Il n'est pas étonnant que l'on
trouve en Angleterre tant de Domestiques François. A
Londres on se plaît à parler notre Langue, on copie nos usages,
on imite nos m&#339;urs: ils entretiennent du moins dans nos

French lackey was "as mischievous all the year as a London
apprentice on Shrove Tuesday";<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> yet he was indispensable:</p>

<p>French cooks were also in great demand, and it was a point
of gentility to dine at one of the French ordinaries. Thus
Briske, in Shadwell's <i>Humourists</i>, is condemned as "a fellow
that never wore a noble or polite garniture, or a white periwig,
one that has not a bit of interest at Chatelin's, or ever ate a good
fricacy, sup, or ragoust in his life"; for now, "like the French
we dress, like Frenchmen eat." "Substantial beef" is "boil'd
in vain," and "our boards are profaned with fricassee":<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a></p>

ordinaries where English food was given a French name.
Yet he admits that at the French houses the table is covered
and the glasses clean, all in the French manner; and when
he dined with his patrons of the Admiralty, he usually was
given a "fine French dinner."<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a></p>

<span class="sidenote">FRENCH SPOKEN AT COURT</span>

The example was set at Court, where French was commonly
in use, and where to be able to speak it well was a necessity
and proof of good breeding. "Mark then, I makes 'em both
speak French to show their breeding," says the author Boyes
of his two kings in Buckingham's <i>Rehearsal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> Sir John
Reresby first attracted notice at Court by his fluent French.
"It was this summer," he writes in 1661, "that the Duke of
York first took any particular notice of me. I happened to
be in discourse with the French Ambassador and some other
gentlemen of his nation, in the presence at Whitehall, and the
Duke joined us, he being a great lover of the French tongue
and kind to those who spoke it. The next night he talked
with me a long while as he was at supper with the king."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>
And Reresby, with a keen eye for his own advancement,
took advantage of this to secure the patronage of the Duke.
He also tells us that the King, Duke, and French ambassador
were very often merry and intimate together at Louise de
Kerouaille's (now Duchess of Portsmouth) lodgings,<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> where
French alone would be used, for it was an unknown thing for
a French ambassador to speak English. There was not a
courtier<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> who did not speak French with ease, Clarendon
alone excepted.</p>

<p>The ladies of the Court were equally well versed in the
language. When De Grammont, who had made the acquaintance
of most of the courtiers in France, came to make that of
the ladies, he needed no interpreter, for all knew French&mdash;"assez
pour s'expliquer et toutes entendaient le françois assez
bien pour ce qu'on avait à leur dire."<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> Amongst them was
Miss Hamilton, Anthony's sister, who became De Grammont's
wife,<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> and was much admired at the Court of Louis XIV.
The accomplishments of Miss Stuart may be quoted as typical
of the rest: "elle avoit de la grâce, dansoit bien, parloit
françois mieux que sa langue naturelle: elle étoit polie,
possédoit cet air de parure après lequel on court et qu'on
n'attrappe guères à moins de l'avoir pris en France dès sa

Blake, who "n'entendoit presque point le françois." When
the Countess of Berkshire recommended one of her near
relatives as one of the queen's dressers, the fact that she had
been twelve years in France, and could speak French exceedingly
well, was mentioned as her chief qualification.<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> The
Portuguese queen<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> was indeed out of place in her Frenchified
Court. She could not speak French, and Spanish was her
means of intercourse with Charles II. and the Duke of York,
who both spoke this language fairly well, and were able to
act as interpreters between their French mother and the
young queen. Catherine's Portuguese attire was the subject
of much amusement, and her efforts to induce the ladies of
the Court to adopt it were of no avail. James II., when he
was an exile in France for the second time, told the nuns of
Chaillot that she had endeavoured to prevail on King Charles
to use his influence with them: "but the ladies dressed in
the French fashions and would not hear of any other, constantly
sending artificers and dressmakers to Paris to import
the newest modes, as they do to this very day."<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> The

<p>In many cases the passion for all things French became a
mania with the ladies, as is frequently pictured in the drama
of the time.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> A Frenchified lady would have a French
maid, "born and bred in France, who could speak English
but brokenly," with whom she would talk a mixture of broken
French and English; while many a one like Melantha of
Dryden's <i>Marriage à-la-mode</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> doted on any new French word:

<span class="sidenote">THE FRENCHIFIED LADY</span>She importunes
those returned from the tour in France, or who have
correspondence with Parisians, to know the latest words used

<p><i>Philotis.</i> <i>Sottises.</i></p>

<p><i>Melantha.</i> <i>Sottises, bon.</i> That's an excellent word to begin withal:
as for example, he or she said a thousand <i>sottises</i> to me. Proceed.</p>

<p><i>Philotis.</i> <i>Figure</i>: as what a <i>Figure</i> of a man is there! <i>Naïve</i> and

<p><i>Philotis.</i> Speaking of a thing that was naturally said: it was so <i>naïve</i>.

<p class="noi">And as Melantha becomes excited with her new acquisitions,
she bestows gifts on her maid at each new word.</p>

a French boarding-school, by a French dancing master, a
French singing master, and a French waiting woman. "Before
I could speak English plain," she tells us, "I was taught
to jabber French: and learnt to dance before I could go:
in short I danced French dances at 8, sang French at 10,
spoke it at 13, and before 15 could talk nothing else."</p>

<p>Among the gentlemen <i>à la mode</i>, "to speak French like a

acted,<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> and the English drama of the period is so full of French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">-378-</a></span>words and phrases that it is hardly intelligible to any one without
a good knowledge of French.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> The Frenchified Gallants
and Ladies, the French Valets, and other French characters
introduced so freely into the plays, offered ample opportunity
for the use of French words.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> Dryden, alone, is responsible

As literature was fashionable at the time, most of the dramatic
authors were themselves gentlemen <i>à la mode</i> with strong
French tastes. Sedley, for instance, had a great reputation
in the world of fashion. Wycherley and Vanbrugh had both
been educated in France. Etherege had probably resided
many years in Paris. Cibber, who always played the part
of the fop in his own plays, went twice to France specially to
study the airs and graces of the French <i>petit-maître</i>,&mdash;at no
better place, however, than a <i>table d'Auberge</i>, the Abbé
Le Blanc tells us:<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> "Il faut lui pardonner ses erreurs sur
ses modèles, il n'étoit à portée d'en voir d'autres: si même
il n'a pas aussi bien imité ceux-ci que les Anglois se le sont
persuadé, je n'en suis pas surpris: il m'a avoué de bonne foi
qu'il n'entend pas assez notre langue pour suivre la conversation."
It is unlikely, however, that Cibber's French was as
scanty as the <i>abbé</i> reports. At any rate his daughter Charlotte,
afterwards Mrs. Clarke, tells us that she understood the
alphabet in French before she was able to speak English.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<p>The prologues and epilogues of the Restoration plays are
frequently addressed to the gallants, and often in a language
which would appeal to them; for instance, a French Marquis
speaks the epilogue in Farquhar's <i>Constant Couple</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... Vat have you English, dat you call your own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vat have you of grand plaisir in dis towne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vidout it come from France, dat will go down?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picquet, basset: your vin, your dress, your dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis all, you zee, tout à-la-mode de France.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<span class="sidenote">FRENCH PLAYS IN LONDON</span>

The Francomaniacs of the time would find still more to
their taste at the French play. During nearly twenty years
after the Restoration, London was hardly ever without a
company of French players. The beaux and gallants flocked
to see "a troop of frisking monsieurs," and cry "Ben" and
"keep time to the cadence of the French verses":<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old English authors vanish and give place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these new conquerors of the Norman race,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">wrote Dryden, protesting against the caprice of the town for
the French comedians; and he adds elsewhere:<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A brisk French troop is grown your dear delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with broad bloody bills, call you each day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To laugh and break your buttons at their play.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">There was a great rush to the French plays, both tragedies
and comedies. Valets went hours in advance to reserve a
place for their masters. There is no need, says Dryden, to
seek far for the reason of their popularity,&mdash;they are French,
and that is enough. People go to show their breeding and
try to laugh at the right moment. The English dramatist
insinuates that the comedians let in their own countrymen
free of charge that they might lead the applause, and give
the cue to the ladies.</p>

<p>The English Court and its followers had evidently acquired
a taste for French plays during their sojourn abroad. Immediately
after the Restoration a French company settled
in London, and the king became their special patron and
protector. In 1661 he made a grant of £300 to Jean Channoveau
to be distributed among the French comedians,<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> and
in 1663 they obtained permission to bring from France their
stage decorations and scenery. It seems to have always been
the king's "pleasure" that "the clothes, vestments, scenes, and
other ornaments proper for and directly designed for their
own use about the stage should be imported customs free."<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>
The earliest troupe of French actors, under Jean Channoveau,
acted at the Cockpit in Drury Lane; and there, on the
30th August 1661, Pepys took his wife to see a French comedy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">-380-</a></span>He carried away a very bad impression of the play, describing
it as "ill done, the scenes and company and everything else
so nasty and out of order and poor, that (he) was sick all the
while in (his) mind to be there." He vented his ill humour
on a friend of Mrs. Pepys whom she had met in France; and
"that done, there being nothing pleasant but the foolery of
the farce, we went home."</p>

<p>French comedies were also acted at Court. Evelyn, who
went very little to the theatre, witnessed one of these on the
16th December 1662, but makes no observation on it. In
the <i>Playhouse to be let</i> of Davenant, who directed the Duke's
company playing at Dorset Gardens,<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> figures a Frenchman
who has brought over a troupe of his countrymen to act a
farce. The French actor Bellerose is said to have made a
fortune by playing in London.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> Another of these actors who
ventured to London was Henri Pitel, sieur de Longchamp,
who came in 1676 with his wife and two daughters.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> He
stayed nearly two years in England, and shone at the Court
of Charles II. Charles himself is said not to have missed one of
the French plays,<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> at which his mistress, Louise de Kerouaille,
Duchess of Portsmouth, Mme. Mazarin, the French ambassador,
and many courtiers were always present. In 1684 the
"Prince's French players" were again expected in England,<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>
no doubt the same troupe, directed by Pitel and known as
<i>Les comédiens de son Altesse sérénissime M. le Prince</i>.</p>

<h3>THE TEACHING OF FRENCH AND ITS POPULARITY AFTER THE RESTORATION</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime French grammars were being published in
England in considerable numbers.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> So plentiful were they
that there was "scarce anything to be seen anywhere but
French grammars." The manuals of Mauger and Festeau
were still in vogue, and that of Mauger was frequently reedited.
Among new grammarians figures the tutor to the
children of the Duke of York (James II.), Pierre de Lainé,
who may possibly have been identical with the Pierre Lainé
who published a grammar in 1655.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> His French grammar,
written in the first place for the Lady Mary (afterwards
Mary II.), was published in 1667,<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> when the princess was
about five years old. It was subsequently placed at the
service of the Lady Anne, afterwards queen, and a second
edition appeared in 1677, with the title: <i>The Princely Way
to the French Tongue as it was first compiled for the use of her
Highness the Lady Mary and since taught her royal sister the
Lady Anne etc. by P. D. L. Tutor for the French to both their
Highnesses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a></p>

<p>"Before you begin anything of Letters or rules," says Lainé,
"you may Learn how to call in French these few things
following.</p>

<div class="table"><table cellspacing="2" summary="Laine">
<tr><td>Ma Tête, say</td>
<td>maw tate</td>
<td>my Head</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mes Cheveuz, say</td>
<td>maysheveu</td>
<td>my Hair,"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noi">and so on for the parts of the body, the numbers, days,
and months, with similar guides to pronunciation. He then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">-382-</a></span>proceeds to treat of the sounds of letters and syllables, based
on comparison with English. These rules occupy less than
a fifth of the book; the remainder contains practical exercises.
First come familiar phrases and dialogues, strongly religious
in tone, including prayers, the catechism, commandments,
etc., and conversation specially suited to royal princesses. A
chronological abridgement of the sacred scriptures by way of
dialogue is followed by rules of grammar, likewise in dialogue
form. Lastly come the <i>Fables</i> of Aesop put into "burlesque
French" for the use of her Highness the Lady Mary when a
child, and models of letters suitable for children, and accompanied
by answers.</p>

<p>In later years Lainé spent some time at Paris as secretary<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a>
to Sir Henry Savile, the English envoy at the French Court,
who did so much to prepare a favourable reception in England
for the refugees at the time of the Revocation of the Edict
of Nantes.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> Lainé was the first teacher to receive a grant of
letters of denization under the Order in Council of the 28th July
1681.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> Shortly afterwards the same privilege was bestowed
on Francis Cheneau, whose <i>French Grammar, enrich'd with a
compendious and easie way to learne the French tongue in a
short time</i>, was licensed for printing in 1684.<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> For many
years Cheneau continued to teach French, and in time added
Latin, English, and Italian to his repertory. He describes
himself as a native of Paris, "formerly slave and Governor
of the Isles of Nacsia and Paros in the Archipelago." At the
time of the appearance of his second work on the French
language, in 1716, he was "living in his House in Old Fish
St. next door to the Faulcon in London," where could be
seen his short grammars for Latin, Italian, and English.</p>

<p>The most versatile compiler of French manuals at this
period was Guy Miège, a native of Lausanne, who came to
England at the time of the Restoration. For two years
he was employed in the household of Lord Elgin, and was
then appointed under-secretary to the Earl of Carlisle, ambassador
extraordinary to Russia, Sweden, and Denmark. After
spending three years abroad with the embassy, he travelled
in France on his own account from 1665 till 1668, preparing
a <i>Relation of the Three Embassies</i> in which he had taken part.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">-383-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">THE DICTIONARIES OF GUY MIÈGE</span>His book was published in 1669, on his return to London.
He then settled in England as a teacher of French and geography,
and wrote many works for teaching the language.
The first was <i>A New Dictionary French and English and English
and French</i> (1677), dedicated to Charles Lennox, Duke of
Richmond. As usual, this French-English Dictionary is
based on a French-Latin one&mdash;in this case that of Pomey.
Miège was also closely acquainted with Howell's edition of
Cotgrave's dictionary, last published in 1670; but he held it
very defective in retaining so many obsolete words, and in
not being adapted to the "present use and modern orthography&mdash;which
indeed is highly pretended to in the last
edition thereof, but so performed that the title runs away
with all the credit of it." He looked upon Cotgrave "as a
good help indeed for reading of old French books (a thing
which few people mind)." For his own part, his design was
to teach the latest Court French, and he made a point of
omitting all the provincial and obsolete words Cotgrave had
searched out so carefully, words "that offend the eyes and
grate the ears, but the Rubbish of the French Tongue." To
"season the naturall dulness of the work" he included many
proverbs, descriptions, and observations in both the English
and French parts.</p>

<p>Considering that "the way to understand the bottom of
a language is to learn how the derivatives are formed from
their primitives and the compounds from their simples,"<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> he
arranged all the derivatives after their respective primitives;
that nothing might be wanting, however, he placed them in
their alphabetic order also, with a reference to the necessary
primitive.</p>

<p>Miège's innovation in excluding all obsolete terms from
his dictionary raised such a storm at its first appearance<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>
that he felt himself bound to yield to public opinion by
making a separate collection of such words, which he called
<i>A Dictionary of barbarous French or A Collection, by way of
Alphabet, of Obsolete, Provincial, misspelt, and Made Words in
French, taken out of Cotgrave's dictionary with some additions</i>.
It was, he said, "performed for the satisfaction of such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">-384-</a></span>read old French." By the time of its publication in 1679,
however, the storm raised by his first work had died away.</p>

<p>Miège continued his lexicographical labours. In 1684
appeared <i>A Short French Dictionary English and French,
with another in French and English</i>, a work of no ambitious
aims, containing a list of words pure and simple, with no
descriptions or observations, intended for beginners, travellers,
and those who could not afford the price of the larger
one, and, above all, for foreigners reading English. The
English were too eager and advanced in the study of French
to find much help in so slight a work, but foreigners
evidently adopted the dictionary; editions appeared at
the Hague in 1691, 1701 (the fifth), and 1703;<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> another
was issued at Rotterdam as late as 1728.</p>

<p>For the use of English students and those desiring to study
either language more thoroughly, Miège prepared, during
many years of hard work, an enlarged edition of his first
French dictionary of 1677, which, he tells us, was compiled
under great disadvantages; "the Publick was in haste for
a French Dictionary, and they had it accordingly, hurried
from the design to the composition, and from under my pen
to the press." The new work, on a much larger scale, was
known as <i>The Great French Dictionary, in two parts</i>, and
published in 1688, eleven years after the appearance of its
nucleus, the <i>New French Dictionary</i> (1677). It gives words
according to both their old and modern orthography, "by
which means the reader is fitted for any sort of French book,"
and, writes Miège, "although I am not fond of obsolete and
barbarous words, yet I thought fit to intersperse the most
remarkable of them, lest they should be missed by such as
read old Books." Each word is accompanied by explanations,
proverbs, phrases, "and as the first part does, here and there,
give a prospect into the constitution of the kingdom of France,
so the second does afford to foreiners what they have hitherto
very much wanted, to wit, an Insight into the Constitution
of England...." In the <i>Great Dictionary</i> Miège abandoned
his plan of arranging the derivatives under their primitives,
because it had made his former work "swarm with uneasy
references"; he followed the alphabetical order strictly,
"but in such a manner that, where a derivative is remote
from its primitive, I show its extraction within a Parenthesis."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">-385-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">MIÈGE'S FRENCH GRAMMARS</span>Each of the two sections of the <i>Great Dictionary</i> is preceded
by a grammar of the language concerned. First comes the
<i>Grounds of the French Tongue</i>, before the French-English
Dictionary, and then a <i>Méthode abrégée pour apprendre
l'Anglois</i>. This French grammar was a reprint of one of those
which Miège had compiled while working at his dictionaries.</p>

<p>In 1684 Miège tells us that he had "put forth two French
grammars, both of them well approved by all unprejudiced
persons. The one is short and concise, fitted for all sorts of
learners, but especially new beginners; the other is a large
and complete piece, giving a curious and full account of the
French Tongue. To this is annexed a copious vocabulary and
a long Train of useful Dialogues." The more advanced of
these grammars was the first to appear, being published in
1678 under the title of <i>A New French Grammar, or a New
Method for learning the French Tongue</i>. After dealing with
pronunciation, he passes to the accidence and syntax, with
special attention to his favourite theory of the importance
of a knowledge of primitives and derivatives. He is much
indebted to the grammars of Vaugelas and Chiflet, especially
in his observations on letter-writing, on repetition of words,
and on style. The second half of the book contains a vocabulary,
arranged under the usual headings, and familiar dialogues,
without which he dare not offer the work to a public "so
well convinced of their Usefulness, as to the speaking part of
a Language"; therefore, "though it were something against
the grain," he included such exercises, "exceeding even Mr.
Mauger's in number." The one hundred and fifteen familiar
dialogues are followed by four more advanced ones in French
alone, "for proficient learners to turn into English." The
first deals with the education of children, and the others with
geography, a subject Miège taught in either French or English
"as might be most convenient."</p>

<p>The elementary grammar had been issued about 1682<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>
as <i>A short and easie French Grammar fitted for all sorts of
learners; according to the present use and modern orthography
of the French with some Reflections on the ancient use thereof</i>.
In 1682 the vocabulary and dialogues of the earlier grammar
were, each of them, issued separately, probably to facilitate
their use with this second grammar.</p>

<p>In 1687 appeared the <i>Grounds of the French Tongue or a
new French Grammar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">-386-</a></span>which Miège incorporated in his <i>Great
French Dictionary</i> in the following year. In general outline
its contents resemble those of the grammar which had appeared
ten years before. It is, however, an entirely new
work. Most of the rules differ,<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> and the vocabulary and
dialogues are new. He breaks away from the old tradition
of introducing the Latin declension of nouns into French
grammars.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> The <i>Grounds of the French Tongue</i> is about a
hundred pages shorter than the grammar of 1678, and on the
whole it is less interesting from the point of view of the student
of French. The second part, called the <i>Nouvelle Nomenclature
Françoise et Angloise</i>, which might be obtained apart
from the grammar, had originally appeared in 1685 as part
of Miège's <i>Nouvelle méthode pour apprendre l'Anglois</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> Consequently
the dialogues are more suited to the student of English
than to the student of French, as they deal chiefly with life
in England and the impressions of a Frenchman in London,
including an account of the coffee-houses, the penny post,
the churches, English food and drink, and so forth.</p>

<p>Lastly, in about 1698,<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> appeared <i>Miège's last and best
French Grammar, or a new Method to learn French, containing
the Quintessence of all other Grammars, with such plain and
easie rules as will make one speedily perfect in that famous
language</i>. A second edition was issued in 1705. The work
was based on his first grammar (1678), which thus benefited
by his long experience as a writer on the French language
and teacher of that tongue.</p>

<p>Miège held that French was best learnt by a combination
of the methods of rote and grammar, either being insufficient
without the other; as for attempting to learn foreign languages
at home by rote, "'tis properly building in the air.
For whatever progress one makes that way, unless he sticks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">-387-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">BEST METHOD OF STUDY</span>constantly to it, the Language steals away from him, and,
like a Building without a foundation, it falls insensibly."
Englishmen who learn French by ear in France soon find the
fluency of which they are so proud slipping away from them
after their return to England;<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> and even Frenchmen who
have never studied their language grammatically begin to
lose the purity of phrase after they have been some time in
England.</p>

<p>Accordingly "a great care ought to be taken to pitch upon
the best sort of Grammar and to make choice of a skilful
Master. Now a skilful master must be first such a one as
can speak the true modern French: A Thing few people can
boast of, besides courtiers and scholars, so nice a language
it is." Therefore the student should not waste his time, as
many do, with the common sort of teachers, who speak, for
the most part, but a corrupt and provincial French, and yet
are patronized by many. In the second place, the teacher
should be a man of some learning; and in the third, he should
have "some skill in the English tongue, not that he should
use much English with his scholars,<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> but because, without
it, 'tis impossible he can teach by the grammar, or explain
the true meaning of words." Lastly, he should himself be
thoroughly acquainted with the grammar, and be able to find
out what should be learnt "by rote, what by heart, and what
passages need not at all be learnt." But, when all is done,
"there is an art in teaching not to be found amongst all men
of knowledge."</p>

<p>Thus the right use of a grammar depends much on the skill
and judgement of the teacher. Miège declares against overburdening
the memory with abstruse and difficult rules. In
most cases it is enough if the learner understands the rule;
there is no need to confine him to the author's words or to
make him learn long lists of exceptions. "The best thing
to exercise his memory in, besides the general and most
necessary rules, is to learn a good store of words with their
signification. And then, whether he comes to read French, or
to hear it spoke, one word doth so help another, that by
degrees, he will find out the meaning." As for the dialogues,
only a few, and those of a familiar type, should be learnt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">-388-</a></span>"without book." "An analysis is the best use they
can be put to, but some teachers will find it too hard a
task."</p>

<p>The best way, therefore, is "to lay a good foundation
with grammar rules, and to raise the Superstructure by Practice";
the more adventurous the learner is in speaking
French the better. If, however, "one be so very averse from
Grammar rules as to look upon them as so many Bug bears,
my opinion is that he may begin by Rote, provided he make
good at last his Proficiency that Way, with the help of a choice
Grammar. And then the Rules will appear to him very plain,
easy and delectable."</p>

<p>In 1678 Miège was receiving pupils for French and geography
at his lodging in Penton Street, Leicester Square,
and we are told that in 1693 he was taking in <i>pensionnaires</i>
in Dean's Yard, near Westminster Abbey. Towards the end
of his teaching career in England he appears to have been
on very friendly terms with another teacher of French,
Francesco Casparo Colsoni, an Italian minister, who also
taught Italian and English. Colsoni wrote a book for teaching
the three languages,<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> called <i>The New Trismagister</i> (1688), in
which he drew freely from the works of Mauger, Festeau, and
his friend Miège. In the meantime other manuals appeared,
including a translation of a grammar which was first published
at Paris in 1672<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>&mdash;<i>A French Grammar, teaching the
knowledge of that language.... Published by the Academy
for the reformation of the French Tongue</i> (1674), printed in
parallel columns of English and the original French. <i>A Very
easie Introduction to the French Tongue</i> was published in
about 1673, which claimed to be "proper for all persons who
have bad memories." A certain John Smith, M.A., J. G.
D'Abadie, formerly of the Royal Musketeers and for a
time teacher of French at Oxford, Jacob Villiers, who had a
French school at Nottingham, and Jean de Kerhuel, a French
minister,<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> all published grammars at about the same time.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

<p>Among the more interesting French teachers of the period
is Pierre Berault, a French monk who was converted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">-389-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">PIERRE BERAULT</span>Protestantism when he was on the point of setting out
for England to work among the refugees as a Jesuit
emissary.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> On the 2nd of April 1671 he "abjured all the
errors of the Church of Rome" in the French Church of the
Savoy, London, and subsequently devoted himself to teaching
French. Until nearly the end of the century he lived in
various parts of London, "waiting upon any Gentlemen or
Gentlewomen who have a mind to learn French," and using,
according to his own account, a very sound method. At
the same time he was busy with his pen. He began with a
compilation setting forth his religious principles,<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> and with
books on moral and religious subjects, in French and English
for the benefit of learners.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> Later he wrote <i>A New, plain,
short and compleat French and English grammar</i> (1688), which
had an "extraordinary sale and reception," and passed
through numerous editions. Berault's motto as regards the
teaching of French was <i>omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile
dulci</i>,&mdash;a fit combination of grammar rules and practical
exercises. The grammar, which occupies less than half the
book, begins with an explanation of grammatical terms for
the benefit of those ignorant of Latin; it then deals shortly
with the pronunciation and the declinable parts of speech;<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>
lastly come a few rules of syntax and short vocabularies
of the indeclinables. The reading exercises open with the
catechism, creeds, commandments, and prayers. The dialogues,
accompanied, contrary to custom, by an interlinear
translation, are at first very simple, and arranged in syllables
for the benefit of beginners, but they become more difficult.
The following is a dialogue between a French tutor and his
scholar:</p>

<p>Berault added a selection of Cordier's Colloquies in French
and English to his work, as well as the usual proverbs, idioms
and polite letters, and a vocabulary. The letters have no
English translation, Berault believing that "whoso will peruse
this grammar, he will not only be able to explain them but
any other French book whatsoever." Accordingly he supplied
a list of what he considered suitable modern French books,
all of which could be obtained from one or other of the French
booksellers in London.</p>

<p>In the second half of the seventeenth century the position
of the French language in England was further strengthened
by its growing popularity all over Europe. "I have visited,"
wrote the dramatist Chappuzeau in 1674,<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> "every part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">-391-</a></span>Christendom with care.
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH AND LATIN</span>It has been easy for me to observe
that to-day a prince with only the French language which
has spread everywhere, has the same advantages that
Mithridates had with twenty-two." The French language was
regarded as "one of the chiefest qualifications of accomplished
persons," and "the common language of all well-bred people,
and the most generally used in the commerce of civil life."
Bayle states that in many parts of Europe there were people
who spoke and wrote French as purely as the French themselves,
and that in many foreign towns all the men and women
of quality and many of the common people spoke French
with ease. Writers of the time are unanimous in describing
French as the universal language; and most French teachers
write in the style of Guy Miège to the effect that "the French
tongue is in a manner grown universal in Europe ... and
of all the parts of Europe next to France none is more fond
of it than England."</p>

<p>Thus, in the second half of the seventeenth century, French
was in a position to dispute its ground with Latin. France
herself set the example. French was the language used at
Court, while Latin was used only by scholars. Significant
it is that in 1676 Louis XIV., in consequence of Charpentier's
<i>Défense de la langue françoise pour l'inscription de l'arc de
Triomphe</i>, replaced the Latin inscriptions on his triumphal
arches by others in French. Replying to Charpentier's
essay, a Jesuit, P. Lucus, wrote a treatise in defence of
Latin.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> Charpentier retorted by two laboured volumes, <i>De
l'excellence de la langue françoise</i> (1683), and finally won the
day. In this he refers to the universality of French, and draws
attention to the advantages which would result to science
if it were studied in that language. The long Quarrel of the
Ancients and Moderns, which first reached England from
France, also shows the spirit of the times. And Bayle asserts
as evidence of the supremacy of French that: "Veut-on
qu'un libelle courre bien le monde, aussitôt on le traduit en
françois, lors même que l'original est en Latin: tant il est
vrai que le latin n'est pas si commun en Europe aujourd'hui
que la Langue françoise."<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

<p>In England French had long been a rival to Latin as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">-392-</a></span>most commonly used foreign tongue, and after the Restoration
it was generally recognized, among courtiers, men of fashion,
ministers of state, and diplomats, as the more convenient
means of intercourse. Only scholars and the universities
continued to uphold the traditional supremacy of the Latin
tongue, and even at the universities Latin had passed out
of colloquial use before the Restoration, though still used in
disputations and other prescribed exercises.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> The victory of
French in the world of fashion was an easy one. It had
"long since chased Latin from the gallant's head," declares
Sedley,<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> and Ravenscroft in his prologue to the <i>English
Lawyer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> in which a jargon made up of Latin and English
predominates, thus addresses the gallants:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gallants, pray what do you doe here to-day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of you understands a Latine play?...<br /></span>

<p>Latin also lost what ground it held as the official language.
Milton had been Latin secretary during the Commonwealth,
but after the Restoration French was the language used.
"Since Latin hath ceased to be a Language, if ever it was any,
which I am not sure of, at least in this present age," wrote
Lord Chancellor Clarendon,<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> "the French is almost naturalised
through Europe, and understood and spoken in all the Northern
Courts and hath nearly driven the Dutch out of its own
country, and almost sides the Italian in the Eastern Parts,
where it was scarce known in the last Age." French, therefore,
had little to fear from Latin as the language of intercourse
with ambassadors and other foreigners in England; and
still less from English, which was not to receive any recognition
at the hands of foreigners for years to come. Considering
the almost universal popularity of French, and the general
neglect of English, most Englishmen were obliged to agree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">-393-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH IN THE SCHOLASTIC WORLD</span>with Clarendon that it was "too late sullenly to affect an
ignorance" of that language because the French "will not
take the Pains to understand ours," and we may gain much
by being conversant in theirs. He adds "it would be a great
Dishonour to the court if, when Ambassadors come thither
from Neighbour Princes, no body were able to treat with them,
or converse with those who accompany them in no other
language but English, of which not one of them understand
one word; not to mention how the king shall be supplied
with Ministers, or Secretaries of State, or with Persons fit
to be sent Ambassadors abroad," if those who aspire to
such rank are not acquainted with the necessary foreign
language.</p>

<p>Before the Restoration, French, in spite of the important
place it held in the world of polite education, had received
very little recognition at the hands of educational writers.
Cleland alone, in his <i>Institution of a Nobleman</i> (1607), had
treated it seriously. After 1660, however, its widespread use
and popularity rendered this omission no longer possible, and
at this time occurs a break in the tradition of classical scholarship.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>
The case for French was put most forcibly and with
greatest effect by Locke in his <i>Thoughts on Education</i>. Referring
to the young scholar, he writes: "As soon as he can
speak English, 'tis time for him to learn some other Language.
This no body doubts of, when French is proposed ...
because French is a living language, and to be used more in
speaking, that should be first learned, that the yet pliant
Organs of Speech might be accustomed to a due formation of
those sounds and he get the habit of pronouncing French well,
which is the harder to be done the longer it is delay'd. When
he can speak French well, (which on conversational methods
is usually in a year or two), he should proceed to Latin."<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>
For the same reasons Clarendon would have French learnt
first, by "rote," "without the Formality or Method of
grammar."<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p>Even in the world of scholarship the traditional deference
shown to ancient learning received some check, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">-394-</a></span>educational value of the ancient languages was called in
question. Some believed that "a gentleman might become
learned by the only assistance of modern languages." Evelyn
wrote a discourse on the subject at the request of Sir Samuel
Tuke for the Duke of Norfolk; unfortunately it was lost, "to
his griefe"<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> and ours. It contained, he told Pepys, "a list
of Authors and a method of reading them to advantage ...
nor was [he] without some purpose of one day publishing it,
because 'twas written with a vertuous designe of provoking
our court fopps and for encouragement of illustrious persons
who have leisure and inclinations to cultivate their minds
beyond a farce, a horse, a whore and a dog, which, with very
little more are the confines of the knowledge and discourse
of most of our fine gentlemen and beaux." Learning, he
felt, would assume a more attractive form in the eyes of the
majority, if it were attained through modern languages.
Defoe likewise thought Latin and Greek were not indispensable
to scholarship, and considered it a pity to lock up all
learning in the dead languages.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> Hobbes even went so far as
to suggest in his <i>Behemoth</i> (<i>c.</i> 1668) that it would be well to
substitute French, Dutch, and Italian for Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew at the universities. Others recommended that the
classics should be read in French translations, and it is probable
that men of fashion at the time read them in this form, if at
all. Sedley implies that to read Terence in Latin was a mark
of ill-breeding.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> The fashionable Etherege, who knew neither
Latin nor Greek, had a large number of French translations
of classical plays amongst his books.<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> And at a somewhat
later date the Abbé Le Blanc remarks<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> that the English have
become so fond of French that they prefer to read even
Cicero in that language. He writes to tell Olivet how
eagerly his translations are received in England. "Celle des
Tusculanes que vous venez de publier de concert avec M. Le
Père Bouhour a été goûtée en Angleterre de tous ceux qui
sont en état de juger des Beautés de l'Original et de la fidélité
avec laquelle chacun de vous les a rendues."</p>

<p>The readiness with which the English read French books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">-395-</a></span>also attracted the Abbé's attention.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a>
<span class="sidenote">PROPOSALS FOR REFORMED SCHOOLS</span>It was no new thing for
French literature to be widely appreciated in England. But
before the Restoration it had received but little recognition
as a profitable subject of study, except for students of statecraft
and military tactics. In 1673, however, one writer<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>
takes a new step in stating that "all learning is now in
French," and goes on to say that if it were in English "those
dead languages would be of little use, only in reference to the
scriptures." Similarly Mary Astell, the author of <i>A Serious
Proposal to the Ladies</i> (1694), urges the ladies, who most of
them know French, to study French Philosophy, Descartes
and Malebranche, rather than restrict themselves to idle novels
and romances. And when Locke was in Paris in 1677 he
bought the best class-books and manuals in French and Latin
for the use of Lord Shaftesbury's grandson. The many
English gentlemen who had French tutors were frequently
taught not only the French language, but other subjects from
French text-books.</p>

<p>There were, moreover, several proposals for reformed
schools,<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> in which French was given a place by the side of
Latin. In the ideal school as pictured by Clarendon, the
master is well acquainted with the French language; and
"those that teach the exercises" are Frenchmen, both that
the scholars "may be accustomed to that language, and retain
what they are supposed to have learnt before, and because
they do teach all Exercises best."<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> Thomas Tryon, the
"Pythagorean," proposed a school in which there was to be
a tutor for French and Latin, or one for each language, and
a music master.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> The scholars should begin at an early age,
and nothing but French and Latin be spoken in their hearing.
The school should stand apart, so that the pupils have no
intercourse with "wild" children. In about a year they learn
French and Latin by conversation, and then other subjects
with the help of these languages. Newcomers soon pick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">-396-</a></span>up a colloquial knowledge of the language by mixing with
their schoolfellows. When they speak the languages perfectly,
then is the time, says Tryon, to study the grammar;
"for to speak is one thing, and the Art or Reason of speaking
is another. The first must be done by Imitation and Practice,
the other is the Work of time, and must be improved by
degrees. They that learn the Art of speaking before they
can speak invert the true Method ... for the Reason and
Philosophy of speaking is a great Art and the work of Time,
and not at all to be taught to children." Before studying
rules the learners should not only speak, but read perfectly.
After learning the letters they should read daily for two or
three hours, "in any book that treats of Temperance and
Vertue."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the increased importance attached to
French in all spheres, the modern language received no status
in the grammar schools, where the sole aim pursued was
"to make good Latin and Greek scholars and minute philosophers."<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a>
On the other hand, the private institutions in
which the language was taught naturally increased very
greatly in number. Many Huguenot refugees opened schools
in and about London, and one French observer was struck
by their number.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> Some arose in provincial towns. At
Nottingham, for instance, an Englishman, Jacob Villiers,
had a school of some importance. Villiers himself was a
well-known citizen. His name appears in the Charter of
1682 as one of the chief councillors of the town; and he was
one of "the council of eighteen" who were displaced by an
order of the Privy Council of 10th February 1688.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> He
was described on his gravestone in St. Mary's Churchyard
as a descendant of a collateral branch of the family of the
great favourite of James I. and Charles I. The family
"continued still in Nottingham" in the middle of the
eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a></p>

<p>Villiers's French school was flourishing some years before
the first mention of him as a public character. He had
acquired his knowledge of French abroad, having travelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">-397-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH SCHOOL AT NOTTINGHAM</span>for many years in France<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> and Germany, where he gave
English lessons and received favours from the Prince Elector
Palatine, elder brother of Prince Rupert. It was no doubt
after his return that he opened his school for gentlemen and
ladies. He also completed a book on the French and English
languages, which was published in London in 1680, "to
gratify the ladies and gentlemen his scholars, and all such
who have a mind so to be." His chief aim was to encourage
the French and English to learn each other's language by
pointing out the close affinity between them. The <i>Vocabularium
Analogicum, or the Englishman speaking French, and
the Frenchman speaking English, Plainly shewing the nearness
or affinity betwixt the English, French and Latin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> contains a
vocabulary of similar words in the three languages&mdash;"a verbal
eccho repeating words thrice and that without any considerable
variation"&mdash;which occupies the main part of the
work.<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> It is preceded by rules for pronouncing French,
taken, without acknowledgement, chiefly from Wodroeph,
and followed by selections from Pierre de Lainé's <i>Royal
French Grammar</i> of 1667. Learners of French are advised
to master the pronunciation first, and to engage a French
master. A collection of familiar phrases and commendatory
and other French verses, some of them also taken from
Wodroeph, close the volume.</p>

<p>Several schools or academies in which young ladies studied
French, as well as philosophy and other serious subjects,
were started at this time, such as that kept by Mrs. Bathsua
Makin, a learned Englishwoman of the day, who for some time
was governess to the daughters of Charles I. Subsequently
she opened a school for gentlewomen, first at Putney (1649)
and afterwards at Tottenham High Cross, "where, by the
blessing of God, Gentlewomen may be instructed in the
Principles of Religion, and in all manner of sober and vertuous
education. More particularly in all things ordinarily taught
in other schools as works of all sorts, dancing, musick, singing
etc." Half their time was employed in acquiring these arts
and the other half in learning the Latin and French tongues.
"Gentlewomen of eight or nine years old, that can read well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">-398-</a></span>may be instructed in a year or two, according to their parts,
in the Latin and French tongues, by such plain and short
rules, <ins title="original: accomodated">accommodated</ins> to the grammar of the English Tongue,
that they may easily keep what they have learned, and recover
what they shall lose." Those wishing to pursue their studies
further could learn other languages, Greek, Hebrew, Italian,
or Spanish, or could study astronomy, geography, and other
subjects. The usual fee was £20 a year, but more was charged if
the pupil made good progress. Parents were advised to apply
for details at Mr. Mason's Coffee House in Cornhill, near the
Royal Exchange, on Tuesday, or on Thursdays at the Bolt and
Tun in Fleet Street, from three to six in the afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p>Mary Astell, another learned Englishwoman, to whom
we have already alluded, came forward with a proposal
advocating a scheme of study for women, in the retirement
of an establishment "more academic than monastic." She
urges her sex to study rhetoric, logic, and philosophy,
and, as most of them know French, to read Descartes and
Malebranche, and not idle novels and romances. The project
ultimately fell to the ground, however, chiefly on account of
the opposition of Bishop Burnet, who condemned it as a
popish design. Shortly afterwards Defoe, who "would deny
women no sort of learning," proposed an academy for women,<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a>
in which they should be taught "all sorts of breeding suitable
to both their genius and their quality, and in particular music
and dancing, which it would be cruelty to bar the sex of,
because they are their darlings: but besides this they should
be taught languages, as particularly French and Italian; and
I would venture the injury of giving a woman more tongues
than one." As to reading, history is the best subject.</p>

<p>There are traces of other academies in which modern
languages and the "exercises" were the chief studies.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> At the
end of <i>Musick or a Parley of Instruments</i>, a musical entertainment
performed by the students of one of these academies,
is an advertisement of the curriculum; instruction in French
and Italian was given by foreigners, and mathematics, music,
and the "exercises" received attention. Mark Lewis, the friend
of Mrs. Makin,<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> taught like her in a school or "gymnasium" at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">-399-</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">FRENCH IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS</span>Tottenham High Cross, where "any person, whether young
or old, as their Quality is, may be perfected in the Tongues
by constant conversation." The school flourished about
1670, and there was then "an apartment for French," while
Italian and Spanish were "to receive attention hereafter."<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>
Lewis's method of teaching so pleased the Earl of Anglesey,
then Lord Privy Seal, that he sent his grandsons to the
school, and enabled Lewis to secure letters patent for his
method. A similar academy was kept by a certain Mr.
Banister in Chancery Lane near the Pump. There was a
wide choice of studies, including Latin, Greek, and French, for
the languages, and the usual "exercises." Any person that
desired could be accommodated in Mr. Banister's house "with
diet and lodging at reasonable Rates, ... or they may come
thither at set times and be Instructed in the things before
mentioned." The academy kept by Thomas Watts in Little
Tower Street differed from the majority in aiming at qualifying
young gentlemen for business. Writing, arithmetic,
and merchants' accounts were taught, as well as mathematics
and experimental philosophy: a master resident in the house
gave lessons in French, a language absolutely necessary to
business men, and "so far universal that the place is not
known where 'tis not spoken." Accordingly it received special
attention; and "as a just notion of grammar, so the opportunity
of frequent conversation, is absolutely necessary, if
one would ever arrive at any Perfection in this Language,"
Watts, therefore, not only "fix'd on a Master capable of doing
the first, but entertained him constantly in his house, where
all those young gentlemen that learn French are obliged
always to speak it, and have their master daily to converse
with."<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> Some academies confined themselves chiefly to the
exercises. But even then the atmosphere was French. Such
was the academy opened in London in 1682 by M. Foubert, a
Frenchman lately come from Paris. He was helped by a
royal grant, and seems to have been fairly successful. On
his arrival his goods were delivered at the house of M. Lainé,<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a>
probably the French teacher of that name.</p>

<p>As time went on such schools became more and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">-400-</a></span>numerous and the demand for instruction in French increased.
The language was no longer limited chiefly to certain classes:
the gentry, merchants, soldiers, and others requiring it for
practical purposes. It came to be regarded as a necessary
part of a liberal education. The ever-growing call for
teachers of French was met by the great invasion of Protestant
refugees caused by the renewal of the fierce persecutions
which culminated in the Revocation of the Edict
of Nantes in 1685. The reception of the fugitives was doubtful
under James II., who looked upon them with disfavour, but
could not, for political reasons, refuse them hospitality. With
the advent of William of Orange in 1689, however, their position
was assured, and they became ardent supporters of the
new monarch. They arrived in such multitudes, says a contemporary,
that it was impossible to calculate their number;
there was hardly an English family of standing in which one
or more refugees did not find a home&mdash;often a permanent one.</p>

<p>From this time dates a new period in the teaching of
French in England, dominated by the influence of these
refugees, from whose ranks the chief tutors and schoolmasters
were recruited, and whose French grammars and
manuals continued, in some cases, to be used till the end of
the eighteenth century, and even later.</p>
